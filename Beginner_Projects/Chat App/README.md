# Real-Time Chat Application

### í ¼í¾¯ **Goal**
To create a simple and effective real-time chat application that allows multiple users to communicate seamlessly over a network using Python's socket programming.

### í ¾í·¾ **Description**
This project implements a basic chat application with a server-client architecture. Users can connect to the server and send messages to each other in real-time. The application features a simple command-line interface that facilitates communication between multiple clients, making it ideal for testing networking concepts and understanding client-server interactions.

### í ¾í·® **What I Have Done!**
1. Developed a multi-threaded server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously.
2. Implemented a client-side interface for sending and receiving messages.
3. Enabled real-time message broadcasting to all connected clients.
4. Created a simple command-line interface for ease of use.
5. Ensured basic error handling for network disconnections and invalid inputs.
6. Organized the code for the server and client into separate files for better clarity and maintainability.

### í ½íº€ **Models Implemented**
This project primarily focuses on:
- Networking using Python's `socket` library.
- Multi-threading for handling multiple clients.
- Simple command-line interface for user interaction.

### í ½í³š **Libraries Needed**
- `socket`
- `threading`

### í ½í³Š **Usage**
Run the server and client scripts using Python:

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python chat_server.py

2. **Start the client**:
   ```bash
   python chat_client.py

### How to Use:
- Upon starting the client, enter your username when prompted.
- Type your messages and hit Enter to send them.
- Messages sent by one client will be displayed to all connected clients.

### í ½í³¢ Conclusion
This Real-Time Chat Application serves as a foundational project for understanding client-server architecture and real-time communication in networking. Its simplicity and effectiveness make it suitable for beginners learning about sockets and threading in Python. This project demonstrates the potential of Python in building networking applications.
