## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python, no separate installation required)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file-organizer.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd file-organizer
```

3. Ensure the Azure-ttk-theme folder is in the correct location, as it is required for the application's theme.
   Without the theme, the application will not work. (Make changes to line number 117 And 120)

```python
window.iconbitmap(r"")
window.resizable(width=True, height=True) # App Icon Location

window.tk.call("source", r"\Theme\azure.tcl")
window.tk.call("set_theme", "light") # `azure.tcl` Location From Theme Folder
```

4. Run the application:

```bash
python App.py
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running 'App.py`.

2. Provide the following information in the GUI:
   - Directory Path: The directory you want to organize.
   - File Extensions: Comma-separated file extensions (e.g., `pdf, txt, docx`).
   - Log File (Optional): Path to a log file for tracking file movements.

3. Click the "Organize Files" button to start the organization process.

4. You can undo the file organization by clicking the "Undo" button.

5. Change the theme between light and dark with the "Theme" button.
