### 🧾 **Description**

This project allows users to fetch detailed stock-related information using the Financial Modeling Prep API. The app returns essential financial data of a company based on the ticker entered by the user. Data includes the company's profile, income statements, EPS trends, and real-time stock quotes.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

1. Created a Flask-based web app to collect the stock ticker from the user.
2. Used the Financial Modeling Prep API to fetch the stock details.
3. Processed the API data and displayed it in a user-friendly format.
4. Created an EPS chart visualization using the stock data.
5. Added company profile and income statement details to the app for easy analysis.
6. Integrated real-time stock quotes into the app for instant updates.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

No machine learning models were implemented in this app. The stock data is purely fetched from the Financial Modeling Prep API and visualized as-is. The EPS trend is displayed in a chart for easier interpretation.

### 📢 **Conclusion**

`The app successfully displays comprehensive financial data for any entered stock ticker. This includes a company's profile, income statement, real-time quotes, and an EPS trend chart to analyze the company's financial health. It serves as a basic stock data retrieval and visualization tool for quick reference.`
