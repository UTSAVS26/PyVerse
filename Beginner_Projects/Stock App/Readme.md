### 🧾 **Description**

This project allows users to fetch detailed stock-related information using the Financial Modeling Prep API.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

2. Used the Financial Modeling Prep API to fetch the stock details.
3. Processed the API data and displayed it in a user-friendly format.
4. Created an EPS chart visualization using the stock data.
5. Added company profile and income statement details to the app for easy analysis.
6. Integrated real-time stock quotes into the app for instant updates.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

No machine learning models were implemented in this app. The stock data is purely fetched from the Financial Modeling Prep API and visualized as-is. The EPS trend is displayed in a chart for easier interpretation.

### 📢 **Conclusion**

`The app successfully displays comprehensive financial data for any entered stock ticker. This includes a company's profile, income statement, real-time quotes, and an EPS trend chart to analyze the company's financial health.
