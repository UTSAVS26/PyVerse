# BMI Calculator with GUI

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**
The aim of this GUI-based BMI calculator is to provide a simple, interactive tool that helps users quickly calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI).


### ðŸš€ **How it works**
Here's a brief explanation of how the GUI-based BMI calculator works:

**User Input:** The user enters their weight in kilograms and height in meters into two text fields provided in the graphical user interface (GUI).

**Calculation:** When the user clicks the "Calculate BMI" button, the program retrieves the input values, converts them to numerical form, and applies the BMI formula.

**Result Display:** 
- The calculated BMI is displayed on the screen.
- Based on the BMI value, the program categorizes the result as:
   * Underweight (BMI < 18.5)
   * Normal weight (BMI 18.5 - 24.9)
   * Overweight (BMI 25 - 29.9)
   * Obesity (BMI â‰¥ 30)

**Error Handling:** If the user enters invalid or non-numerical values, the program shows an error message prompting the user to input valid data.

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Used**
- `tkinter`
