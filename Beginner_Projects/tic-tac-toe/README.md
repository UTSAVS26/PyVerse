Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Tkinter

üåÄ Overview
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game supports two players, where Player 1 uses 'X' and Player 2 uses 'O'. The goal is to be the first to get three marks in a row‚Äîeither horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

The project is beginner-friendly and a great way to learn about GUI development using Python and Tkinter. It can be further expanded with more features like AI opponents, score tracking, or different themes.

üõ†Ô∏è Features
Two-Player Mode: Players alternate between 'X' and 'O' to take turns.
Winner Detection: The game detects when a player has won or if the game is a tie.
Reset Button: Allows the game to be reset after completion without restarting the program.
Graphical Interface: Built using Tkinter, providing a clean and interactive interface for users.

-README.md       # Documentation for the project

üöÄ Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Tkinter is part of the Python standard library, so no extra installation is needed in most cases. If Tkinter is missing, install it using the following command:


# For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
sudo apt-get install python3-tk

# For Windows and Mac, Tkinter should come pre-installed with Python.
Installation
Clone the repository (or download the .py file).


git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-tkinter.git
Navigate to the project directory.


cd tic-tac-toe-tkinter
Run the Tic-Tac-Toe game.


python tic_tac_toe.py

üíª How to Play
Start the game: Once the game window opens, the first player (X) can click on any cell to make their move.
Switch turns: After Player 1 (X) has made a move, Player 2 (O) will get their turn.
Winning or Tie: The game will detect if there is a winner (3 marks in a row) or if the game is a tie (no more moves left).
Reset: You can click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

‚ú® Future Enhancements
Single-player mode: Implement AI-based player to compete against the human.
Scoreboard: Keep track of how many games each player has won.
Themes: Add more themes or styles to the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
Timer: Introduce a timer to limit each player's move time.
