## **Password Generator**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The goal of this project is to create a simple number guessing game using Streamlit. 

### 🧵 **Dataset**

N/A

### 🧾 **Description**

This project is a Number Guessing Game where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it. It implements some fundamental programming concepts of Python. It provides an engaging, interactive experience where users can repeatedly guess until they find the correct number, offering immediate feedback.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

1. Built a simple Streamlit interface for users to guess a number between 1-100
2. The game continues indefinitely until the correct number is guessed. If the guess is too low, it prompts the player to try again. If the guess is too high, it prompts the player to try again.
3. If the guess is correct, the player is congratulated, the number of attempts is displayed, and the loop ends.


### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

N/A

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**

1. `Streamlit` - For building the user interface.
2. `random` - To randomly select a number for the user to guess 

### 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis Results**

N/A. 

### 📈 **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

N/A. 

### 📢 **Conclusion**

In conclusion, this Number Guessing Game project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as random number generation, user input handling, loops, and error handling in Python. It provides an engaging, interactive experience where users can repeatedly guess until they find the correct number, offering immediate feedback. The code is simple yet effective, making it a great learning project for beginner developers looking to strengthen their understanding of basic programming logic.
