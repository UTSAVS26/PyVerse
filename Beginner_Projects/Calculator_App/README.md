# Scientific Calculator with Modern GUI

### üéØ **Goal**
To create a user-friendly and visually appealing scientific calculator application with a modern graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and Tkinter.

### üßæ **Description**
This project implements a Scientific Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. It supports basic arithmetic operations and a variety of scientific functions, all wrapped in a sleek and modern design. The calculator provides an intuitive interface for performing complex calculations seamlessly.

### üßÆ **Features**
1. **Modern, Flat GUI Design:** Utilizes Tkinter and `ttk` styling for a contemporary look and feel.
2. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. **Scientific Functions:** Includes functions like sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`), square root (`‚àö`), logarithm (`log`), exponentiation (`exp`), and inverse trigonometric functions.
4. **Memory Operations:** Features memory functions such as `MC`, `MR`, `M+`, and `M-`.
5. **Constants and Special Functions:** Offers mathematical constants (œÄ, e), power functions (`x^y`), and factorial calculation (`!`).
6. **Error Handling:** Displays "Error" for invalid inputs or operations, ensuring robustness.
7. **Class-based Code Structure:** Organized in a class-based format for better readability and maintainability.
8. **Custom Color Scheme:** Provides a visually appealing user experience with a custom color palette.

### üöÄ **What's New!**
1. Reordered the calculator buttons to a traditional layout for a more intuitive user experience.
2. Enhanced the button arrangement to follow the typical calculator format with grouped functions and number buttons.
3. Improved error handling for special functions like factorial and inverse trigonometric functions.
4. Added additional functions for inverse trigonometric calculations (`sin‚Åª¬π`, `cos‚Åª¬π`) and grouped them with other scientific functions.
5. Improved button styling with different styles for number, operator, memory, and special function buttons.
6. Updated grid layout configuration to adjust dynamically based on window size.

### üìö **Libraries Used**
- `tkinter` - For creating the graphical user interface.
- `math` - For performing scientific calculations.

### üìä **How to Use**
1. Run the script using Python:

```
python main.py
```
The calculator window will appear, and you can start performing calculations.

### **Usage Instructions:**
- Click on the number buttons to input numbers.
- Use the operator buttons (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for basic arithmetic operations.
- For scientific functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `‚àö`, `log`, `exp`, `sin‚Åª¬π`, `cos‚Åª¬π`), first enter a number and then click the function button.
- Use the memory buttons (`MC`, `MR`, `M+`, `M-`) for memory-related operations.
- Press `=` to evaluate the expression.
- Press `C` to clear the display.

### üßÆ **Calculator Layout**
The buttons are laid out in the following order:

- **Memory Functions:** `MC`, `MR`, `M+`, `M-`, `C`
- **Scientific Functions:** `œÄ`, `e`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`
- **Standard Buttons:** `7`, `8`, `9`, `/`, `‚àö`
- **Standard Buttons:** `4`, `5`, `6`, `*`, `x^y`
- **Standard Buttons:** `1`, `2`, `3`, `-`, `log`
- **Standard Buttons:** `0`, `.`, `=`, `+`, `exp`
- **Additional Functions:** `(`, `)`, `!`, `sin‚Åª¬π`, `cos‚Åª¬π`

### üì¢ **Conclusion**
This Scientific Calculator with Modern GUI provides a user-friendly interface for performing both basic and advanced mathematical calculations. Its sleek design, robust functionality, and error handling make it suitable for students, professionals, and anyone who needs a reliable calculator application. The project showcases the potential of Python and Tkinter in creating functional, modern desktop applications.
