# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple command-line Python game where the user plays Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer. The computer makes a random choice of rock, paper, or scissors, and the player inputs their choice. The program then compares the two choices and declares the winner.

## How it Works
- The computer randomly selects one of the options: rock, paper, or scissors.
- The user enters their choice.
- The program compares the userâ€™s choice with the computer's choice.
  - Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
  - If both the user and computer make the same choice, it results in a tie.
- The result (win, lose, or tie) is printed on the screen.

## Features
- Input validation to ensure the user enters a valid option.
- Ability to play multiple rounds until the user decides to quit.
- Random choice generation using Python's `random.choice()` function.

## Skills Practiced
- Random number generation with `random.choice()`.
- Loops to allow for continuous play.
- Conditional statements (`if-else`) to determine the winner.
- Input handling and validation.

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script from the command line using: `python rock_paper_scissors.py`.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
