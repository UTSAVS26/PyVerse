# Dungeon Exploration Game

This is a luck-based, auto-playing dungeon exploration game where you play as a character battling monsters, collecting treasure, and surviving through random encounters. The game is built using Python, and it runs in a GUI powered by Streamlit. All encounters and events are generated randomly using the `random` module.

## Features

- **Explore the Dungeon**: Move through the dungeon and face random events like monsters, treasure, or finding nothing.
- **Battle Monsters**: Fight monsters that appear randomly. Both player and monster attacks are based on random damage.
- **Treasure Collection**: Find treasure randomly during exploration or after defeating monsters.
- **Health & Treasure Tracking**: Your character's health and collected treasure are displayed on the screen.

## How to Play

1. Enter your character's name in the input field.
