# Alphabet Patterns

This project contains scripts for generating patterns using English alphabets. It includes implementations in both Python and C++, showcasing different approaches to creating these patterns with nested loops.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:

- `Python/`: Contains individual Python scripts for printing alphabet patterns.
- `C++/`: Contains C++ source files for printing the same alphabet patterns.

Each script demonstrates the pattern generation for a specific letter, using nested loops to print different shapes.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Python

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `Python/` folder.
3. Run a script with:

   ```bash
   python3 A.py
   ```

### C++

1. Make sure a C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`) is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `C++/` folder.
3. Compile the source file:

   ```bash
   g++ A.cpp -o A
   ```
4. Run the compile program
   ```./A
   ```

## 💡 Learning Objectives
- Practice logic building for generating different shapes using loops.
- Understand the use of nested loops in pattern printing.
- Compare solutions in Python and C++ for different approaches.
