🧾 Description
This project is a Temperature Conversion Tool where users can convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. It implements fundamental programming concepts in Python and provides an engaging, interactive experience where users can input a temperature and receive immediate feedback on its conversions.

🧮 What I had done!
Built a simple Streamlit interface for users to input a temperature value and select the unit for conversion.
The tool converts the input temperature to the other two units (Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin) and displays the results immediately.
Error handling is implemented to manage invalid inputs gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
