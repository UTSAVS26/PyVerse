# Simple Malware Scanner

## Overview

This is a simple malware scanner written in Python. It allows users to scan individual files or directories for known malware by comparing their hash values against a predefined list of malicious signatures. This tool is lightweight and designed to provide a basic level of malware detection using SHA-256 hash comparisons.

## Features

- **File Scanning**: Scan individual files for known malware by checking their hash values.
- **Directory Scanning**: Recursively scan all files within a directory to detect any potential malware.
- **Malware Detection**: Uses SHA-256 hashing to compare files against known malware signatures.
- **Logging**: Logs the results of the scans, including the files that were scanned and any malware detected.
- **Color-Coded Output**: Uses color-coded messages to indicate whether a file is clean or potentially malicious.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface for scanning files or directories.

## Libraries Needed

To run the malware scanner, you'll need the following Python libraries:

1. **`hashlib`** (Python Standard Library) - Used for generating the SHA-256 hashes of files.
2. **`os`** (Python Standard Library) - Used to check file paths and traverse directories.
3. **`logging`** (Python Standard Library) - Used for logging scan results.
4. **`colorama`** - Used to display colored output in the terminal. 

## Conclusion

This simple malware scanner provides a foundational tool for detecting known malware based on hash signatures. While it is not a complete antivirus solution, it can be useful for basic scanning tasks or as part of a larger security toolkit. It demonstrates how file integrity can be checked using hash comparisons and how malware signatures can be detected in a straightforward manner.
