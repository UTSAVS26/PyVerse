# Video Forensics Analysis Tool

## Abstract

The **Video Forensic Analysis Tool** is designed to ensure the authenticity and integrity of digital video content. In fields like law enforcement and journalism, reliable video evidence is crucial. This tool uses advanced techniques such as metadata examination, frame-by-frame analysis, deepfake detection, and watermark authentication to detect video tampering and manipulations. It generates detailed forensic reports to aid investigative professionals in ensuring the credibility of video evidence.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Interactive web-based application using Streamlit.
- **Video Input**: Supports video file formats such as MP4, AVI, and MOV (file size limit: 200MB).
- **Metadata Extraction**: Provides key details such as resolution, codec, frame count, duration, and geolocation data (if available).
- **Hashing (MD5)**: Verifies the integrity of the video by generating a unique hash for comparison.
- **Frame Analysis**: Detects tampering through frame-by-frame inspection for splicing, insertion, and pixel pattern anomalies.
- **Comprehensive Report Generation**: Outputs a JSON report with all findings, including extracted metadata and hash values.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV, FFmpeg, hashlib, os, json
- **Web Framework**: Streamlit
- **Hashing Algorithm**: MD5
