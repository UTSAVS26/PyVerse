## **Encryption Decryption App**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The goal of this project is to create a simple encryption and decryption app using Streamlit. 

### ðŸ§µ **Dataset**

N/A

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

This project is a simple web application built using Streamlit, designed to demonstrate basic encryption and decryption techniques using two well-known algorithms: Caesar Cipher and VigenÃ¨re Cipher.

### ðŸ§® **What I had done!**

1. Built a simple, user-friendly Streamlit interface for users to encrypt and decrypt their messages using basic algorithms like Caesar Cipher and VigenÃ¨re Cipher.
2. Set up input fields for users to enter messages, select encryption methods, and perform actions (encrypt or decrypt) via buttons and dropdown menus.


### ðŸš€ **Models Implemented**
