Packet Sniffer Tool
ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is to create a simple network packet sniffer that captures and analyzes network packets using Python and Scapy.

ðŸ§¾ Description
This project is a straightforward application built using Python and Scapy, designed to capture and analyze network packets in real-time. The tool displays essential information, including source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data for each captured packet.

ðŸ§® What I Accomplished

Developed a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to start packet sniffing and view packet details in real-time.
Implemented functionality to analyze packets for common protocols such as TCP and UDP, displaying relevant data such as IP addresses and payload contents.
ðŸš€ Algorithms Implemented

Packet Capture: Utilized Scapy's sniffing capabilities to capture network packets.
Packet Analysis: Analyzed captured packets for IP, TCP, and UDP layers to extract and display relevant information.
ðŸ“š Libraries Needed

Scapy: For capturing and analyzing network packets.
ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
The Packet Sniffer Tool serves as an effective introduction to network packet analysis, showcasing the implementation of real-time packet capturing and protocol analysis using Scapy. This project provides a simple yet powerful way for users to monitor network traffic and understand the structure of packets traversing their network.
