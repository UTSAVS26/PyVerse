## **Password Strength Checker**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The goal of this code is to create a simple password strength checker which provides feedback to the user on how the password can be improved.

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

The program evaluates the strength of a password provided by the user. It assesses various criteria such as length, character types, and common patterns to give users personalized feedback and tips for improving their passwords. The application aims to help users create more secure passwords, thus enhancing their overall online security.

Key Features:

- Comprehensive Password Evaluation: The tool checks for various criteria such as length, use of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters to evaluate password strength.
- Feedback and Suggestions: After analyzing the password, the program provides detailed feedback, including tips on how to improve password strength based on the specific weaknesses identified.
- Repetition and Sequence Detection: The program detects repeated characters and simple sequences (like "1234" or "abcd") that can make a password easier to guess, providing users with alerts to avoid these patterns. If a user inputs a password that is too common, it alerts them and suggests a more unique alternative.


### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

To run the Password Strength Checker, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `re`: This is a built-in Python library for regular expressions, used to check password criteria.
- `ipywidgets`: This library is used for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter Notebooks. 

### **How to run the code**

- Install the necessary libraries.
- Launch Jupyter Notebook in your terminal or Anaconda prompt by typing jupyter notebook.
- Copy the provided password strength checker code into a new cell in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Execute the cell. The program will display tips for creating a strong password.
- When prompted, enter a password to check its strength. The program will evaluate the password and provide overall feedback along with personalized improvement suggestions.

### ðŸ“¢ **Conclusion**

The Password Strength Checker is a simple yet effective tool for promoting better password practices among users. By evaluating common vulnerabilities and providing constructive feedback, the program encourages users to create stronger passwords, thereby enhancing their security in digital spaces.
