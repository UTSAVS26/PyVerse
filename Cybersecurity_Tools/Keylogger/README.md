## **Simple keylogger**

### ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**

The goal of this project is to create a simple keylogger.

### ðŸ§µ **Dataset**

N/A

### ðŸ§¾ **Description**

This program is a basic keylogger that captures keystrokes and logs them into a text file. It uses the `pynput` library to listen to keyboard events. The keylogger logs both normal and special keystrokes into the file and stops when the Esc key is pressed.

### ðŸ§® **What I had done!**

1. Built a simple keylogger that logs keystrokes pressed.
2. It logs both normal and special keystrokes and stores them into a text file (keystrokes_log.txt)
3. The keylogger continues logging into the text file until the Esc key is pressed


### ðŸš€ **Models Implemented**

N/A

### ðŸ“š **Libraries Needed**

1. `pynput` - This library is used to capture keyboard events (keypresses and releases).

### ðŸ“Š **Exploratory Data Analysis Results**

N/A. 

### ðŸ“ˆ **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

N/A. 

### ðŸ“¢ **Conclusion**

This keylogger program efficiently captures and logs keystrokes using the pynput library. It records both regular and special keys into a text file, periodically writing data to avoid losing information. The program runs until the "Esc" key is pressed, making it suitable for monitoring keyboard input in a non-intrusive way
