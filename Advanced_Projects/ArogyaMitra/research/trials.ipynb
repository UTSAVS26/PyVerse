A transmit-ter sends high frequency sound waves into the body,where they bounce off the different tissues and organs toproduce a distinctive pattern of echoes. A receiver“hears” the returning echo pattern and forwards it to acomputer, which translates the data into an image on atelevision screen. Because ultrasound can distinguishsubtle variations between soft, fluid-filled tissues, it isparticularly useful in providing diagnostic images of theabdomen. Ultrasound can also be used in treatment.\\nPurpose\\nThe potential medical applications of ultrasound\\nwere first recognized in the 1940s as an outgrowth of thesonar technology developed to detect submarines duringWorld War II. The first useful medical images were pro-duced in the early 1950s, and, by 1965, ultrasound quali-ty had improved to the point that it came into generalmedical use. Improvements in the technology, applica-tion, and interpretation of ultrasound continue. Its lowcost, versatility, safety and speed have brought it into thetop drawer of medical imaging techniques.While pelvic ultrasound is widely known and com-\\nmonly used for fetal monitoring during pregnancy ,\\nultrasound is also routinely used for general abdominalimaging. It has great advantage over x-ray imaging tech-nologies in that it does not damage tissues with ionizingradiation. Ultrasound is also generally far better thanplain x rays at distinguishing the subtle variations of softtissue structures, and can be used in any of severalmodes, depending on the need at hand.\\nAs an imaging tool, abdominal ultrasound generally\\nis warranted for patients afflicted with: chronic or acuteabdominal pain ; abdominal trauma; an obvious or sus-\\npected abdominal mass; symptoms of liver disease, pan-creatic disease, gallstones , spleen disease, kidney dis-\\nease and urinary blockage; or symptoms of an abdominalaortic aneurysm . Specifically:\\n• Abdominal pain. Whether acute or chronic, pain can\\nsignal a serious problem—from organ malfunction orinjury to the presence of malignant growths. Ultrasoundscanning can help doctors quickly sort through poten-tial causes when presented with general or ambiguoussymptoms. All of the major abdominal organs can bestudied for signs of disease that appear as changes insize, shape and internal structure.\\n• Abdominal trauma. After a serious accident, such as a\\ncar crash or a fall, internal bleeding from injuredabdominal organs is often the most serious threat tosurvival. Neither the injuries nor the bleeding areimmediately apparent. Ultrasound is very useful as aninitial scan when abdominal trauma is suspected, and itcan be used to pinpoint the location, cause, and severityof hemorrhaging. In the case of puncture wounds ,f r o m\\na bullet for example, ultrasound can locate the foreignobject and provide a preliminary survey of the damage.The easy portability and versatility of ultrasound tech-nology has brought it into common emergency roomuse, and even into limited ambulance service.\\n• Abdominal mass.

In\\nparticular, potentially malignant solid tumors can bedistinguished from benign fluid-filled cysts andabscesses. Masses and malformations in any organ orpart of the abdomen can be found.\\n• Liver disease. The types and underlying causes of liver\\ndisease are numerous, though jaundice tends to be a\\ngeneral symptom. Ultrasound can differentiate betweenmany of the types and causes of liver malfunction, andis particularly good at identifying obstruction of thebile ducts and cirrhosis , which is characterized by\\nabnormal fibrous growths and reduced blood flow.\\n• Pancreatic disease. Inflammation and malformation of\\nthe pancreas are readily identified by ultrasound, as arepancreatic stones (calculi), which can disrupt properfunctioning.\\n• Gallstones. Gallstones cause more hospital admissions\\nthan any other digestive malady. These calculi cancause painful inflammation of the gallbladder and alsoobstruct the bile ducts that carry digestive enzymesfrom the gallbladder and liver to the intestines. Gall-stones are readily identifiable with ultrasound.\\n• Spleen disease. The spleen is particularly prone to\\ninjury during abdominal trauma. It may also becomepainfully inflamed when beset with infection orcancer . These conditions also lend themselves well to\\nultrasonic inspection and diagnosis.\\n• Kidney disease. The kidneys are also prone to traumatic\\ninjury and are the organs most likely to form calculi,which can block the flow of urine and cause blood poi-\\nsoning (uremia). A variety of diseases causing distinct\\nchanges in kidney morphology can also lead to com-plete kidney failure. Ultrasound imaging has provenextremely useful in diagnosing kidney disorders.\\n• Abdominal aortic aneurysm. This is a bulging weak\\nspot in the abdominal aorta, which supplies blooddirectly from the heart to the entire lower body. Theseaneurysms are relatively common and increase inprevalence with age. A burst aortic aneurysm is immi-nently life-threatening. However, they can be readilyidentified and monitored with ultrasound before acutecomplications result.\\nUltrasound technology can also be used for treat-\\nment purposes, most frequently as a visual aid duringsurgical procedures—such as guiding needle placementto drain fluid from a cyst, or to extract tumor cells forbiopsy. Increasingly, direct therapeutic applications forultrasound are being developed.\\nThe direct therapeutic value of ultrasonic waves lies\\nin their mechanical nature. They are shock waves, just likeaudible sound, and vibrate the materials through whichthey pass. These vibrations are mild, virtually unnotice-\\nable at the frequencies and intensities used for imaging.Properly focused however, high-intensity ultrasound canbe used to heat and physically agitate targeted tissues.\\nHigh-intensity ultrasound is used routinely to treat\\nsoft tissue injuries, such as strains, tears and associatedscarring. The heating and agitation are believed to pro-mote rapid healing through increased circulation. Strong-ly focused, high-intensity, high-frequency ultrasound canalso be used to physically destroy certain types oftumors, as well as gallstones and other types of calculi.Developing new treatment applications for ultrasound isan active area of medical research.\\nPrecautions\\nProperly performed, ultrasound imaging is virtually\\nwithout risk or side effects. Some patients report feelinga slight tingling and/or warmth while being scanned, butmost feel nothing at all. Ultrasound waves of appropriatefrequency and intensity are not known to cause or aggra-vate any medical condition, though any woman whothinks she might be pregnant should raise the issue withher doctor before undergoing an abdominal ultrasound.\\nThe value of ultrasound imaging as a medical tool,\\nhowever, depends greatly on the quality of the equipmentused and the skill of the medical personnel operating it.Improperly performed and/or interpreted, ultrasound canbe worse than useless if it indicates that a problem existswhere there is none, or fails to detect a significant condi-tion. Basic ultrasound equipment is relatively inexpen-sive to obtain, and any doctor with the equipment canperform the procedure whether qualified or not. Patientsshould not hesitate to verify the credentials of techni-cians and doctors performing ultrasounds, as well as thequality of the equipment used and the benefits of the pro-posed procedure.\\nIn cases where ultrasound is used as a treatment tool,\\npatients should educate themselves about the proposedprocedure with the help of their doctors—as is appropri-ate before any surgical procedure. Also, any abdominalultrasound procedure, diagnostic or therapeutic, may behampered by a patient’s body type or other factors, suchas the presence of excessive bowel gas (which is opaqueto ultrasound). In particular, very obese people are oftennot good candidates for abdominal ultrasound.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound includes all sound waves above the fre-\\nquency of human hearing—about 20 thousand hertz, orcycles per second. Medical ultrasound generally uses fre-quencies between one and 10 million hertz (1-10 MHz).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 2Abdominal ultrasoundGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 2'),\n",

While notnecessarily harmful, such organs can cause prob-lems if they grow too large or become cancerous. Inany case, their presence points to an underlyingabnormality in the parent organ.\\nBenign —In medical usage, benign is the opposite of\\nmalignant. It describes an abnormal growth that isstable, treatable and generally not life-threatening.\\nBiopsy —The surgical removal and analysis of a tis-\\nsue sample for diagnostic purposes. Usually, theterm refers to the collection and analysis of tissuefrom a suspected tumor to establish malignancy.\\nCalculus —Any type of hard concretion (stone) in\\nthe body, but usually found in the gallbladder, pan-creas and kidneys. They are formed by the accumu-lation of excess mineral salts and other organicmaterial such as blood or mucous. Calculi (pl.) cancause problems by lodging in and obstructing theproper flow of fluids, such as bile to the intestines orurine to the bladder.\\nCirrhosis —A chronic liver disease characterized by\\nthe invasion of connective tissue and the degenera-tion of proper functioning—jaundice is often anaccompanying symptom. Causes of cirrhosis includealcoholism, metabolic diseases, syphilis and conges-tive heart disease.\\nCommon bile duct —The branching passage\\nthrough which bile—a necessary digestiveenzyme—travels from the liver and gallbladder intothe small intestine. Digestive enzymes from thepancreas also enter the intestines through the com-mon bile duct.\\nComputed tomography scan (CT scan) —A special-\\nized type of x-ray imaging that uses highly focusedand relatively low energy radiation to producedetailed two-dimensional images of soft tissuestructures, particularly the brain. CT scans are thechief competitor to ultrasound and can yield higherquality images not disrupted by bone or gas. Theyare, however, more cumbersome, time consumingand expensive to perform, and they use ionizing\\nelectromagnetic radiation.\\nDoppler —The Doppler effect refers to the apparent\\nchange in frequency of sound wave echoes returningto a stationary source from a moving target. If theobject is moving toward the source, the frequencyincreases; if the object is moving away, the frequen-cy decreases. The size of this frequency shift can beused to compute the object’s speed—be it a car onthe road or blood in an artery. The Doppler effectholds true for all types of radiation, not just sound.\\nFrequency —Sound, whether traveling through air\\nor the human body, produces vibrations—mole-cules bouncing into each other—as the shock wavetravels along. The frequency of a sound is the num-ber of vibrations per second. Within the audiblerange, frequency means pitch—the higher the fre-quency, the higher a sound’s pitch.\\nIonizing radiation —Radiation that can damage liv-\\ning tissue by disrupting and destroying individualcells at the molecular level. All types of nuclearradiation—x rays, gamma rays and beta rays—arepotentially ionizing. Sound waves physically vibratethe material through which they pass, but do notionize it.\\nJaundice —A condition that results in a yellow tint\\nto the skin, eyes and body fluids. Bile retention inthe liver, gallbladder and pancreas is the immediatecause, but the underlying cause could be as simpleas obstruction of the common bile duct by a gall-stone or as serious as pancreatic cancer. Ultrasoundcan distinguish between these conditions.\\nMalignant —The term literally means growing worse\\nand resisting treatment. It is used as a synonym forcancerous and connotes a harmful condition thatgenerally is life-threatening.\\nMorphology —Literally, the study of form.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 17}, page_content='Higher frequency ultrasound waves produce more\\ndetailed images, but are also more readily absorbed andso cannot penetrate as deeply into the body. Abdominalultrasound imaging is generally performed at frequenciesbetween 2-5 MHz.\\nAn ultrasound machine consists of two parts: the\\ntransducer and the analyzer. The transducer both producesthe sound waves that penetrate the body and receives thereflected echoes. Transducers are built around piezoelec-tric ceramic chips. (Piezoelectric refers to electricity thatis produced when you put pressure on certain crystalssuch as quartz). These ceramic chips react to electric puls-es by producing sound waves ( they are transmittingwaves) and react to sound waves by producing electricpulses (receiving). Bursts of high frequency electric puls-es supplied to the transducer causes it to produce thescanning sound waves. The transducer then receives thereturning echoes, translates them back into electric pulsesand sends them to the analyzer—a computer that orga-nizes the data into an image on a television screen.\\nBecause sound waves travel through all the body’s\\ntissues at nearly the same speed—about 3,400 miles perhour—the microseconds it takes for each echo to bereceived can be plotted on the screen as a distance into thebody. The relative strength of each echo, a function of thespecific tissue or organ boundary that produced it, can beplotted as a point of varying brightness. In this way, theechoes are translated into a picture. Tissues surroundedby bone or filled with gas (the stomach, intestines andbowel) cannot be imaged using ultrasound, because thewaves are blocked or become randomly scattered.\\nFour different modes of ultrasound are used in med-\\nical imaging:\\n• A-mode. This is the simplest type of ultrasound in\\nwhich a single transducer scans a line through the bodywith the echoes plotted on screen as a function ofdepth. This method is used to measure distances withinthe body and the size of internal organs. Therapeuticultrasound aimed at a specific tumor or calculus is alsoA-mode, to allow for pinpoint accurate focus of thedestructive wave energy.\\n• B-mode. In B-mode ultrasound, a linear array of trans-\\nducers simultaneously scans a plane through the bodythat can be viewed as a two-dimensional image onscreen. Ultrasound probes containing more than 100transducers in sequence form the basis for these mostcommonly used scanners, which cost about $50,000.\\n• M-Mode. The M stands for motion. A rapid sequence\\nof B-mode scans whose images follow each other insequence on screen enables doctors to see and mea-sure range of motion, as the organ boundaries thatproduce reflections move relative to the probe. M-mode ultrasound has been put to particular use in\\nstudying heart motion.\\n• Doppler mode. Doppler ultrasonography includes the\\ncapability of accurately measuring velocities of movingmaterial, such as blood in arteries and veins. The prin-ciple is the same as that used in radar guns that measurethe speed of a car on the highway. Doppler capability ismost often combined with B-mode scanning to produceimages of blood vessels from which blood flow can bedirectly measured. This technique is used extensively toinvestigate valve defects, arteriosclerosis and hyper-\\ntension , particularly in the heart, but also in the abdom-\\ninal aorta and the portal vein of the liver. Thesemachines cost about $250,000.\\nThe actual procedure for a patient undergoing an\\nabdominal ultrasound is relatively simple, regardless ofthe type of scan or its purpose. Fasting for at least eight\\nhours prior to the procedure ensures that the stomach isempty and as small as possible, and that the intestinesand bowels are relatively inactive. Fasting also allows thegall bladder to be seen, as it contracts after eating andmay not be seen if the stomach is full. In some cases, afull bladder helps to push intestinal folds out of the wayso that the gas they contain does not disrupt the image.The patient’s abdomen is then greased with a special gelthat allows the ultrasound probe to glide easily across theskin while transmitting and receiving ultrasonic pulses.\\nThis procedure is conducted by a doctor with the\\nassistance of a technologist skilled in operating theequipment. The probe is moved around the abdomen toobtain different views of the target areas. The patient willlikely be asked to change positions from side to side andto hold their breath as necessary to obtain the desiredviews. Discomfort during the procedure is minimal.\\nThe many types and uses of ultrasound technology\\nmakes it difficult to generalize about the time and costsinvolved. Relatively simple imaging—scanning a suspi-cious abdominal mass or a suspected abdominal aorticaneurysm—will take about half an hour to perform andwill cost a few hundred dollars or more, depending onthe quality of the equipment, the operator and other fac-tors. More involved techniques such as multiple M-modeand Doppler-enhanced scans, or cases where the targetsnot well defined in advance, generally take more timeand are more expensive.\\nRegardless of the type of scan used and the potential\\ndifficulties encountered, ultrasound remains faster andless expensive than computed tomography scans (CT),\\nits primary rival in abdominal imaging.

Thestomach and intestines begin development outside thebaby’s abdomen and only later does the abdominal wallenclose them. Occasionally, either the umbilical openingis too large, or it develops improperly, allowing the bow-els or stomach to remain outside or squeeze through theabdominal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are many causes for birth defects that still\\nremain unclear. Presently, the cause(s) of abdominal walldefects is unknown, and any symptoms the mother mayhave to indicate that the defects are present in the fetusare nondescript.\\nDiagnosis\\nAt birth, the problem is obvious, because the base of\\nthe umbilical cord at the navel will bulge or, in worsecases, contain viscera (internal organs). Before birth, anultrasound examination may detect the problem. It isalways necessary in children with one birth defect to lookfor others, because birth defects are usually multiple.\\nTreatment\\nAbdominal wall defects are effectively treated with\\nsurgical repair. Unless there are accompanying anom-alies, the surgical procedure is not overly complicated.The organs are normal, just misplaced.

The organs themselves are fully function-al; the difficulty lies in fitting them inside the abdomen.The condition is, in fact, a hernia requiring only replace-\\nment and strengthening of the passageway throughwhich it occurred. After surgery, increased pressure inthe stretched abdomen can compromise the function ofthe organs inside.\\nPrevention\\nSome, but by no means all, birth defects are pre-\\nventable by early and attentive prenatal care, good nutri-\\ntion, supplemental vitamins , diligent avoidance of all\\nunnecessary drugs and chemicals—especially tobacco—and other elements of a healthy lifestyle.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nDunn, J.

Although D&X is high-\\nly controversial, some physicians argue that it has advan-tages that make it a preferable procedure in some circum-stances. One perceived advantage is that the fetus isremoved largely intact, allowing for better evaluation andautopsy of the fetus in cases of known fetal anomalies.\\nIntact removal of the fetus may also confer a lower riskof puncturing the uterus or damaging the cervix. Anotherperceived advantage is that D&X ends the pregnancywithout requiring the woman to go through labor, whichmay be less emotionally traumatic than other methods oflate-term abortion. In addition, D&X may offer a lowercost and shorter procedure time.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen considering D&X should be aware of the\\nhighly controversial nature of this procedure. A contro-versy common to all late-term abortions is whether thefetus is viable, or able to survive outside of the woman’sbody. A specific area of controversy with D&X is thatfetal death does not occur until after most of the fetalbody has exited the uterus. Several states have takenlegal action to limit or ban D&X and many physicianswho perform abortions do not perform D&X. This mayrestrict the availability of this procedure to women seek-ing late-term abortion.\\nDescription\\nIntact D&X, or partial birth abortion first involves\\nadministration of medications to cause the cervix todilate, usually over the course of several days. Next, thephysician rotates the fetus to a footling breech position.The body of the fetus is then drawn out of the uterus feetfirst, until only the head remains inside the uterus. Then,the physician uses an instrument to puncture the base ofthe skull, which collapses the fetal head. Typically, thecontents of the fetal head are then partially suctioned out,which results in the death of the fetus, and reduces thesizes of the fetal head enough to allow it to pass throughthe cervix. The dead and otherwise intact fetus is thenremoved from the woman’s body.\\nPreparation\\nMedical preparation for D&X involves an outpatient\\nvisit to administer medications, such as laminaria ,t o\\ncause the cervix to begin dilating.\\nIn addition, preparation may involve fulfilling local\\nlegal requirements, such as a mandatory waiting period,counseling, or an informed consent procedure reviewingstages of fetal development, childbirth , alternative abor-\\ntion methods, and adoption.KEY TERMS\\nCervix —The narrow outer end of the uterus that\\nseparates the uterus from the vaginal canal.\\nFootling breech —A position of the fetus while in\\nthe uterus where the feet of the fetus are nearestthe cervix would be the first part of the fetus to exitthe uterus, with the head of the fetus being the lastpart to exit the uterus.\\nLaminaria —A medical product made from a cer-\\ntain type of seaweed that is physically placed nearthe cervix to cause it to dilate.\\nAftercare\\nD&X typically does not require an overnight hospi-\\ntal stay, so a follow up appointment may be scheduled tomonitor the woman for any complications.\\nRisks\\nWith all abortion, the later in pregnancy an abortion\\nis performed, the more complicated the procedure andthe greater the risk of injury to the woman. In addition toassociated emotion reactions, D&X carries the risk ofinjury to the woman, including heavy bleeding, bloodclots, damage to the cervix or uterus, pelvic infection,and anesthesia-related complications. There is also a riskof incomplete abortion, meaning that the fetus is notdead when removed from the woman’s body. Possiblelong-term risks include difficulty becoming pregnant orcarrying a future pregnancy to term.\\nNormal results\\nThe expected outcome of D&X is the termination of\\na pregnancy with removal of a dead fetus from thewoman’s body.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nEpner, Janet E., et al. “Late-term Abortion.” JAMA 280, no. 8\\n(26 August 1998): 724-729.\\nSprang, M.

But multi-fetal pregnan-cies occur far more often in women using fertility drugs.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause women or couples who use fertility drugs\\nhave made an extra effort to become pregnant, it is possi-ble that the individuals may be unwilling or uncomfort-able with the decision to abort a fetus in cases of multi-fetal pregnancy. Individuals engaging in fertility treat-ment should be made aware of the risk of multi-fetalpregnancy and consider the prospect of recommendedreduction before undergoing fertility treatment.\\nDescription\\nSelective reduction is usually performed between\\nnine and 12 weeks of pregnancy and is most successfulwhen performed in early pregnancy. It is a simple proce-dure and can be performed on an outpatient basis. A nee-dle is inserted into the woman’s stomach or vagina andpotassium chloride is injected into the fetus.\\nPreparation\\nIndividuals who have chosen selective reduction to\\nsafeguard the remaining fetuses should be counseledprior to the procedure. Individuals should receive infor-mation regarding the risks of a multi-fetal pregnancy toboth the fetuses and the mother compared with the risksafter the reduction.\\nIndividuals seeking an abortion for any reason\\nshould consider the ethical implications whether it bebecause the fetus is not the preferred sex or because thefetus would be born with a severe birth defect.\\nAftercare\\nCounseling should continue after the abortion\\nbecause it is a traumatic event. Individuals may feelguilty about choosing one fetus over another. Mentalhealth professionals should be consulted throughout theprocess.\\nRisks\\nAbout 75% of women who undergo selective reduc-\\ntion will go into premature labor . About 4-5% of\\nwomen undergoing selective reduction also miscarry oneor more of the remaining fetuses. The risks associatedwith multi-fetal pregnancy is considered higher.\\nNormal results\\nIn cases where a multi-fetal pregnancy, three or\\nmore fetuses, is reduced to two, the twin fetuses typicallydevelop as they would as if they were conceived as twins.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKnobil, Ernst and Jimmy D.

Womenhave abortions because continuing the pregnancy wouldcause them hardship, endanger their life or health, orbecause prenatal testing has shown that the fetus will beborn with severe abnormalities.\\nAbortions are safest when performed within the first\\nsix to 10 weeks after the last menstrual period. The cal-culation of this date is referred to as the gestational ageand is used in determining the stage of pregnancy. Forexample, a woman who is two weeks late having herperiod is said to be six weeks pregnant, because it is sixweeks since she last menstruated.\\nAbout 90% of women who have abortions do so\\nbefore 13 weeks and experience few complications.Abortions performed between 13-24 weeks have a higherKEY TERMS\\nMulti-fetal pregnancy —A pregnancy of two or\\nmore fetuses.\\nSelective reduction —Typically referred to in cases\\nof multifetal pregnancy, when one or more fetusesare aborted to preserve the viability of the remain-ing fetuses and decrease health risks to the mother.rate of complications. Abortions after 24 weeks are\\nextremely rare and are usually limited to situations wherethe life of the mother is in danger.\\nPrecautions\\nMost women are able to have abortions at clinics or\\noutpatient facilities if the procedure is performed early inpregnancy. Women who have stable diabetes, controlledepilepsy, mild to moderate high blood pressure, or whoare HIV positive can often have abortions as outpatientsif precautions are taken. Women with heart disease, pre-vious endocarditis ,asthma , lupus erythematosus, uter-\\nine fibroid tumors, blood clotting disorders, poorly con-trolled epilepsy, or some psychological disorders usuallyneed to be hospitalized in order to receive special moni-toring and medications during the procedure.\\nDescription\\nV ery early abortions\\nBetween five and seven weeks, a pregnancy can be\\nended by a procedure called menstrual extraction. Thisprocedure is also sometimes called menstrual regulation,mini-suction, or preemptive abortion. The contents of theuterus are suctioned out through a thin (3-4 mm) plastictube that is inserted through the undilated cervix. Suctionis applied either by a bulb syringe or a small pump.\\nAnother method is called the “morning after” pill, or\\nemergency contraception . Basically, it involves taking\\nhigh doses of birth control pills within 24 to 48 hours ofhaving unprotected sex. The high doses of hormonescauses the uterine lining to change so that it will not sup-port a pregnancy. Thus, if the egg has been fertilized, it issimply expelled from the body.\\nThere are two types of emergency contraception.\\nOne type is identical to ordinary birth control pills, anduses the hormones estrogen and progestin). This type isavailable with a prescription under the brand name Pre-ven. But women can even use their regular birth controlpills for emergency contraception, after they check withtheir doctor about the proper dose. About half of womenwho use birth control pills for emergency contraceptionget nauseated and 20 percent vomit. This method cuts therisk of pregnancy 75 percent.\\nThe other type of morning-after pill contains only\\none hormone: progestin, and is available under the brandname Plan B. It is more effective than the first type witha lower risk of nausea and vomiting . It reduces the risk\\nof pregnancy 89 percent.\\nWomen should check with their physicians regard-\\ning the proper dose of pills to take, as it depends on the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 9Abortion, therapeuticGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 9'),\n",

This results in an incompleteabortion that means the pregnancy continues.\\nFirst trimester abortions\\nThe first trimester of pregnancy includes the first 13\\nweeks after the last menstrual period. In the UnitedStates, about 90% of abortions are performed during thisperiod. It is the safest time in which to have an abortion,and the time in which women have the most choice ofhow the procedure is performed.\\nMEDICAL ABORTIONS. Medical abortions are brought\\nabout by taking medications that end the pregnancy. Theadvantages of a first trimester medical abortion are:\\n• The procedure is non-invasive; no surgical instruments\\nare used.\\n• Anesthesia is not required.• Drugs are administered either orally or by injection.• The procedure resembles a natural miscarriage .\\nDisadvantages of a medical abortion are:\\n• The effectiveness decreases after the seventh week.• The procedure may require multiple visits to the doctor.\\n• Bleeding after the abortion lasts longer than after a sur-\\ngical abortion.\\n• The woman may see the contents of her womb as it is\\nexpelled.\\nTwo different medications can be used to bring about\\nan abortion. Methotrexate (Rheumatrex) works by stop-ping fetal cells from dividing which causes the fetus to die.\\nOn the first visit to the doctor, the woman receives\\nan injection of methotrexate. On the second visit, abouta week later, she is given misoprostol (Cytotec), anoxygenated unsaturated cyclic fatty acid responsible forvarious hormonal reactions such as muscle contraction(prostaglandin), that stimulates contractions of theuterus. Within two weeks, the woman will expel thecontents of her uterus, ending the pregnancy. A follow-up visit to the doctor is necessary to assure that theabortion is complete.\\nWith this procedure, a woman will feel cramping\\nand may feel nauseated from the misoprostol. Thiscombination of drugs is 90-96% effective in endingpregnancy.\\nMifepristone (RU-486), which goes by the brand\\nname Mifeprex, works by blocking the action of prog-esterone, a hormone needed for pregnancy to continue,then stimulates uterine contractions thus ending thepregnancy. It can be taken a much as 49 days after thefirst day of a woman’s last period. On the first visit tothe doctor, a woman takes a mifepristone pill. Two dayslater she returns and, if the miscarriage has notoccurred, takes two misoprostol pills, which causes theuterus to contract. Five percent of women won’t need totake misoprostol. After an observation period, shereturns home.\\nWithin four days, 90% of women have expelled the\\ncontents of their uterus and completed the abortion.Within 14 days, 95-97% of women have completed theabortion. A third follow-up visit to the doctor is neces-sary to confirm through observation or ultrasound thatthe procedure is complete. In the event that it is not, asurgical abortion is performed. Studies show that 4.5 to 8percent of women need surgery or a blood transfusion\\nafter taking mifepristone, and the pregnancy persists inabout 1 percent of women. In this case, surgical abortionis recommended because the fetus may be damanged.Side effects include nausea, vaginal bleeding and heavycramping.

The amount of discomfort a womanfeels varies considerably. Local anesthesia is oftengiven to numb the cervix, but it does not mask uterinecramping. After a few hours of rest, the woman mayreturn home.\\nSecond trimester abortions\\nAlthough it is better to have an abortion during the\\nfirst trimester, some second trimester abortions may beinevitable. The results of genetic testing are often not\\navailable until 16 weeks. In addition, women, especiallyteens, may not have recognized the pregnancy or come toterms with it emotionally soon enough to have a firsttrimester abortion. Teens make up the largest group hav-ing second trimester abortions.\\nSome second trimester abortions are performed as a\\nD & E. The procedures are similar to those used in thefirst trimester, but a larger suction tube must be usedbecause more material must be removed. This increasesthe amount of cervical dilation necessary and increasesthe risk of the procedure. Many physicians are reluctantto perform a D & E this late in pregnancy, and for somewomen is it not a medically safe option.\\nThe alternative to a D & E in the second trimester is\\nan abortion by induced labor.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='Description\\nThere are two types of abscesses, septic and sterile.\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means that they are theresult of an infection. Septic abscesses can occur any-where in the body. Only a germ and the body’s immuneresponse are required. In response to the invading germ,white blood cells gather at the infected site and beginproducing chemicals called enzymes that attack the germby digesting it. These enzymes act like acid, killing thegerms and breaking them down into small pieces that canbe picked up by the circulation and eliminated from thebody. Unfortunately, these chemicals also digest bodytissues. In most cases, the germ produces similar chemi-cals. The result is a thick, yellow liquid—pus—contain-ing digested germs, digested tissue, white blood cells,and enzymes.\\nAn abscess is the last stage of a tissue infection that\\nbegins with a process called inflammation. Initially, asthe invading germ activates the body’s immune system,several events occur:\\n• Blood flow to the area increases.• The temperature of the area increases due to the\\nincreased blood supply.\\n• The area swells due to the accumulation of water, blood,\\nand other liquids.\\n• It turns red.• It hurts, because of the irritation from the swelling and\\nthe chemical activity.\\nThese four signs—heat, swelling, redness, and pain—\\ncharacterize inflammation.\\nAs the process progresses, the tissue begins to turn\\nto liquid, and an abscess forms. It is the nature of anabscess to spread as the chemical digestion liquefiesmore and more tissue. Furthermore, the spreading fol-lows the path of least resistance—the tissues most easilydigested. A good example is an abscess just beneath theskin. It most easily continues along beneath the skinrather than working its way through the skin where itcould drain its toxic contents. The contents of the abscessalso leak into the general circulation and produce symp-toms just like any other infection. These include chills,fever , aching, and general discomfort.\\nSterile abscesses are sometimes a milder form of the\\nsame process caused not by germs but by non-living irri-tants such as drugs. If an injected drug like penicillin isnot absorbed, it stays where it was injected and maycause enough irritation to generate a sterile abscess—sterile because there is no infection involved. Sterileabscesses are quite likely to turn into hard, solid lumps asthey scar, rather than remaining pockets of pus.Causes and symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pus-forming (pyogenic) bacteria likeStaphylococcus aureus , which is nearly always the cause\\nof abscesses under the skin. Abscesses near the largebowel, particularly around the anus, may be caused byany of the numerous bacteria found within the largebowel. Brain abscesses and liver abscesses can be causedby any organism that can travel there through the circula-tion. Bacteria, amoeba, and certain fungi can travel inthis fashion. Abscesses in other parts of the body arecaused by organisms that normally inhabit nearby struc-tures or that infect them. Some common causes of specif-ic abscesses are:\\n• skin abscesses by normal skin flora• dental and throat abscesses by mouth flora• lung abscesses by normal airway flora, pneumonia\\ngerms, or tuberculosis\\n• abdominal and anal abscesses by normal bowel flora\\nSpecific types of abscesses\\nListed below are some of the more common and\\nimportant abscesses.\\n• Carbuncles and other boils . Skin oil glands (sebaceous\\nglands) on the back or the back of the neck are the onesusually infected. The most common germ involved isStaphylococcus aureus . Acne is a similar condition of\\nsebaceous glands on the face and back.\\n• Pilonidal abscess. Many people have as a birth defect a\\ntiny opening in the skin just above the anus.

Pain\\nand tenderness on physical examination are commonfindings. Sometimes a deep abscess will eat a small chan-nel (sinus) to the surface and begin leaking pus. A sterileabscess may cause only a painful lump deep in the but-tock where a shot was given.\\nTreatment\\nSince skin is very resistant to the spread of infection,\\nit acts as a barrier, often keeping the toxic chemicals ofan abscess from escaping the body on their own. Thus,the pus must be drained from the abscess by a physician.The surgeon determines when the abscess is ready fordrainage and opens a path to the outside, allowing thepus to escape. Ordinarily, the body handles the remaininginfection, sometimes with the help of antibiotics or other\\ndrugs. The surgeon may leave a drain (a piece of cloth orrubber) in the abscess cavity to prevent it from closingbefore all the pus has drained out.\\nAlternative treatment\\nIf an abscess is directly beneath the skin, it will be\\nslowly working its way through the skin as it is morerapidly working its way elsewhere. Since chemicalswork faster at higher temperatures, applications of hotcompresses to the skin over the abscess will hasten thedigestion of the skin and eventually result in its breakingdown, releasing the pus spontaneously. This treatment isbest reserved for smaller abscesses in relatively less dan-gerous areas of the body—limbs, trunk, back of the neck.It is also useful for all superficial abscesses in their veryearly stages. It will “ripen” them.\\nContrast hydrotherapy , alternating hot and cold\\ncompresses, can also help assist the body in resorption ofthe abscess.

Turkington\\nAbuse\\nDefinition\\nAbuse is defined as any thing that is harmful, injuri-\\nous, or offensive. Abuse also includes excessive andwrongful misuse of anything. There are several major typesof abuse: physical and sexual abuse of a child or an adult,substance abuse, elderly abuse, and emotional abuse.\\nDescription\\nPhysical abuse of a child is the infliction of injury by\\nan other person. The injuries can include punching, kick-ing, biting, burning, beating, or pulling the victim’s hair.The physical abuse inflicted on a child can result inbruises ,burns ,poisoning , broken bones, and internal\\nhemorrhages. Physical assault against an adult primarilyoccurs with women, usually in the form of domestic vio-lence. It is estimated that approximately three millionchildren witness domestic violence every year.\\nSexual abuse of a child refers to sexual behavior\\nbetween an adult and child or between two children, oneof whom is dominant or significantly older. The sexualbehaviors can include touching breasts, genitals, and but-tocks; either dressed or undressed. The behavior can alsoinclude exhibitionism, cunnilingus, fellatio, or penetra-tion of the vagina or anus with sexual organs or objects.\\nPornographic photography is also used in sexual\\nabuse with children. Reported sex offenders are 97%male. Females are more often perpetrators in child-caresettings, since children may confuse sexual abuse by afemale with normal hygiene care. Sexual abuse by step-fathers is five times more common than with biologicalfathers. Sexual abuse of daughters by stepfathers orfathers is the most common form of incest.\\nSexual abuse can also take the form of rape. The\\nlegal definition of rape includes only slight penile pene-tration in the victim’s outer vulva area. Complete erec-tion and ejaculation are not necessary. Rape is the perpe-tration of an act of sexual intercourse whether:\\n• will is overcome by force or fear (from threats or by use\\nof drugs).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 16AbuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 16'),\n",

Thecriteria include one or more of the following occurringwithin a 12-month period:\\n• recurrent substance use resulting in failure to fulfill\\nobligations at home, work, or school.\\n• using substance in situations that are physically danger-\\nous (i.e., while driving).\\n• recurrent substance-related legal problems.\\n• continued usage despite recurrent social and interper-\\nsonal problems (i.e., arguments and fights with signifi-cant other).\\nAbuse in the elderly is common and occurs mostly\\nas a result of caretaker burnout, due to the high level ofdependency frail, elderly patients usually require. Abusecan be manifested by physical signs, fear, and delayingor not reporting the need for advanced medical care.Elderly patients may also exhibit financial abuse (moneyor possessions taken away) and abandonment.\\nEmotional abuse generally continues even after phys-\\nical assaults have stopped. In most cases it is a personallytailored form of verbal or gesture abuse expressed to illic-it a provoked response.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nChildren who have been abused usually have a variety\\nof symptoms that encompass behavioral, emotional, andpsychosomatic problems. Children who have been physi-cally abused tend to be more aggressive, angry, hostile,depressed, and have low self-esteem. Additionally, theyexhibit fear, anxiety , and nightmares. Severe psychological\\nproblems may result in suicidal behavior or posttraumaticstress disorder. Physically abused children may complain\\nof physical illness even in the absence of a cause. Theymay also suffer from eating disorders and encopresis. Chil-dren who are sexually abused may exhibit abnormal sexualbehavior in the form of aggressiveness and hyperarousal.Adolescents may display promiscuity, sexual acting out,and—in some situations—homosexual contact.\\nPhysical abuse directed towards adults can ultimately\\nlead to death . Approximately 50% of women murdered\\nin the United States were killed by a former or currentmale partner. Approximately one-third of emergencyroom consultations by women were prompted due todomestic violence. Female victims who are married alsohave a higher rate of internal injuries and unconscious-KEY TERMS\\nEncopresis —Abnormalities relating to bowel move-\\nments that can occur as a result of stress or fear.\\nness than victims of stranger assault (mugging, robbery).\\nPhysical abuse or rape can also occur between marriedpersons and persons of the same gender. Perpetrators usu-ally sexually assault their victims to dominate, hurt, anddebase them. It is common for physical and sexual vio-lence to occur at the same time. A large percentage of sex-ually assaulted persons were also physically abused in theform of punching, beating, or threatening the victim witha weapon such as a gun or knife. Usually males who arehurt and humiliated tend to physical assault personswhom they are intimately involved with, such as spousesand/or children. Males who assault a female tend to haveexperienced or witnessed violence during childhood.They also tend to abuse alcohol, to be sexually assaultive,and are at increased risk for assaultive behavior directedagainst children. Jealous males tend to monitor thewomen’s movements and whereabouts and to isolateother sources of protection and support. They interprettheir behavior as betrayal of trust and this causes resent-ment and explosive anger outbursts during periods of los-ing control. Males may also use aggression againstfemales in an effort to control and intimidate partners.\\nAbuse in the elderly usually occurs in the frail, elderly\\ncommunity. The caretaker is usually the perpetrator. Care-taker abuse can be suspected if there is evidence suggest-ing behavioral changes in the elderly person when thecaretaker is present. Additionally, elderly abuse can bepossible if there are delays between injuries and treatment,inconsistencies between injury and explanations, lack ofhygiene or clothing, and prescriptions no being filled.\\nDiagnosis\\nChildren who are victims of domestic violence are\\nfrequently injured attempting to protect their motherfrom an abusive partner. Injuries are visible by inspectionor self-report. Physical abuse of an adult may be also beevident by inspection with visible cuts and/or bruises orself report.\\nSexual abuse of both a child and an adult can be\\ndiagnosed with a history from the victim. Victims can beassessed for ejaculatory evidence from the perpetrator.Ejaculatory specimens can be retrieved from the mouth,rectum, and clothing. Tests for sexually transmitted dis-\\neases may be performed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 17AbuseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 17'),\n",

The diagnosis can be madeafter administration of a comprehensive bio-psycho-social exam and standardized chemical abuse assess-ments by a therapist.\\nTreatment\\nChildren who are victims of physical or sexual abuse\\ntypically require psychological support and medical atten-tion. A complaint may be filed with the local family socialservices that will initiate investigations. The authoritieswill usually follow up the allegation or offense. Childrenmay also be referred for psychological evaluation and/ortreatment. The victim may be placed in foster care pendingthe investigation outcome. The police may also investigatephysical and sexual abuse of an adult. The victim mayrequire immediate medical care and long-term psychologi-cal treatment.

Children of sexual abuse may as adults enterabusive relationships or have problems with intimacy.The substance abuser may experience relapses, since thecardinal feature of all addictive disorders is a tendency toreturn to symptoms. Elderly patients may suffer fromfurther medical problems and/or anxiety, and in somecases neglect may precipitate death.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention programs are geared to education and\\nawareness. Detection of initial symptoms or characteris-tic behaviors may assist in some situations. In some\\ncases treatment may be sought before incident.

Aceta-\\nminophen—or APAP—is sold under various brandnames, including Tylenol, Panadol, Aspirin Free Anacin,\\nand Bayer Select Maximum Strength Headache Pain\\nRelief Formula. Many multi-symptom cold, flu, andsinus medicines also contain acetaminophen. Check theingredients listed on the container to see if aceta-minophen is included in the product.\\nStudies have shown that acetaminophen relieves pain\\nand reduces fever about as well as aspirin. But differencesbetween these two common drugs exist. Acetaminophenis less likely than aspirin to irritate the stomach. However,unlike aspirin, acetaminophen does not reduce the red-ness, stiffness, or swelling that accompany arthritis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe usual dosage for adults and children age 12 and\\nover is 325-650 mg every 4- 6 hours as needed. No morethan 4 grams (4000 mg) should be taken in 24 hours.Because the drug can potentially harm the liver, peoplewho drink alcohol in large quantities should take consid-erably less acetaminophen and possibly should avoid thedrug completely.\\nFor children ages 6-11 years, the usual dose is 150-\\n300 mg, three to four times a day. Check with a physicianfor dosages for children under age 6 years.\\nPrecautions\\nNever take more than the recommended dosage of\\nacetaminophen unless told to do so by a physician ordentist.\\nPatients should not use acetaminophen for more than\\n10 days to relieve pain (5 days for children) or for morethan 3 days to reduce fever, unless directed to do so by aphysician. If symptoms do not go away—or if they getworse—contact a physician. Anyone who drinks three ormore alcoholic beverages a day should check with aphysician before using this drug and should never takemore than the recommended dosage. A risk of liver dam-age exists from combining large amounts of alcohol andacetaminophen. People who already have kidney or liverdisease or liver infections should also consult with aphysician before using the drug. So should women whoare pregnant or breastfeeding.\\nSmoking cigarettes may interfere with the effective-\\nness of acetaminophen. Smokers may need to take higherdoses of the medicine, but should not take more than therecommended daily dosage unless told by a physician todo so.KEY TERMS\\nArthritis —Inflammation of the joints.

Before having medical tests done, check tosee whether taking acetaminophen will affect the results.Avoiding the drug for a few days before the tests may benecessary.\\nSide effects\\nAcetaminophen causes few side effects. The most\\ncommon one is lightheadedness. Some people mayexperience trembling and pain in the side or the lowerback. Allergic reactions do occur in some people, butthey are rare. Anyone who develops symptoms such asa rash, swelling, or difficulty breathing after takingacetaminophen should stop taking the drug and getimmediate medical attention. Other rare side effectsinclude yellow skin or eyes, unusual bleeding or bruis-ing, weakness, fatigue , bloody or black stools, bloody\\nor cloudy urine, and a sudden decrease in the amountof urine.\\nOverdoses of acetaminophen may cause nausea,\\nvomiting, sweating, and exhaustion.

A ring of muscle called the lower esophagealsphincter encircles the esophagus just above the entrance tothe stomach. This sphincter muscle is normally contractedto close the esophagus. When the sphincter is closed, thecontents of the stomach cannot flow back into the esopha-gus. Backward flow of stomach contents (reflux) can irri-tate and inflame the esophagus, causing symptoms such asheartburn . The act of swallowing causes a wave of\\nesophageal contraction called peristalsis. Peristalsis pushesfood along the esophagus. Normally, peristalsis causes theesophageal sphincter to relax and allow food into the stom-ach. In achalasia, which means “failure to relax,” theesophageal sphincter remains contracted. Normal peristal-sis is interrupted and food cannot enter the stomach.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAchalasia is caused by degeneration of the nerve\\ncells that normally signal the brain to relax theesophageal sphincter. The ultimate cause of this degener-ation is unknown. Autoimmune disease or hidden infec-tion is suspected.\\nSymptoms\\nDysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is the most com-\\nmon symptom of achalasia. The person with achalasia usu-ally has trouble swallowing both liquid and solid foods,often feeling that food “gets stuck” on the way down. Theperson has chest pain that is often mistaken for angina\\npectoris (cardiac pain). Heartburn and difficulty belchingare common. Symptoms usually get steadily worse. Othersymptoms may include nighttime cough or recurrent\\npneumonia caused by food passing into the lower airways.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of achalasia begins with a careful medical\\nhistory. The history should focus on the timing of symp-toms and on eliminating other medical conditions thatmay cause similar symptoms. Tests used to diagnoseachalasia include:\\n• Esophageal manometry. In this test, a thin tube is\\npassed into the esophagus to measure the pressureexerted by the esophageal sphincter.\\n• X ray of the esophagus. Barium may be swallowed to\\nact as a contrast agent. Barium reveals the outlines ofthe esophagus in greater detail and makes it easier tosee its constriction at the sphincter.\\n• Endoscopy. In this test, a tube containing a lens and a\\nlight source is passed into the esophagus. Endoscopy isused to look directly at the surface of the esophagus.This test can also detect tumors that cause symptomslike those of achalasia. Cancer of the esophagus occurs\\nas a complication of achalasia in 2-7% of patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe first-line treatment for achalasia is balloon dila-\\ntion. In this procedure, an inflatable membrane or bal-loon is passed down the esophagus to the sphincter andinflated to force the sphincter open. Dilation is effectivein about 70% of patients.\\nThree other treatments are used for achalasia when\\nballoon dilation is inappropriate or unacceptable.\\n• Botulinum toxin injection. Injected into the sphincter,\\nbotulinum toxin paralyzes the muscle and allows it torelax. Symptoms usually return within one to two years.\\n• Esophagomyotomy. This surgical procedure cuts the\\nsphincter muscle to allow the esophagus to open.Esophagomyotomy is becoming more popular with thedevelopment of techniques allowing very small abdom-inal incisions.\\n• Drug therapy. Nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker,\\nreduces muscle contraction. Taken daily, this drug pro-vides relief for about two-thirds of patients for as longas two years.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with achalasia can be treated effective-\\nly. Achalasia does not reduce life expectancy unlessesophageal carcinoma develops.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 20AchalasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 20'),\n",

The disorder appears in approxi-mately one in every 10,000 births. Achondroplasia isusually diagnosed at birth, owing to the characteristicappearance of the newborn.\\nNormal bone growth depends on the production of\\ncartilage (a fibrous connective tissue). Over time, calci-um is deposited within the cartilage, causing it to hard-en and become bone. In achondroplasia, abnormalitiesof this process prevent the bones (especially those inthe limbs) from growing as long as they normallyshould, at the same time allowing the bones to becomeabnormally thickened. The bones in the trunk of thebody and the skull are mostly not affected, although theopening from the skull through which the spinal cordpasses (foramen magnum) is often narrower than nor-mal, and the opening (spinal canal) through which thespinal cord runs in the back bones (vertebrae) becomesincreasingly and abnormally small down the length ofthe spine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAchondroplasia is caused by a genetic defect. It is a\\ndominant trait, meaning that anybody with the geneticdefect will display all the symptoms of the disorder.

Although achondroplasia can be\\npassed on to subsequent offspring, the majority of casesoccur due to a new mutation (change) in a gene. Interest-ingly enough, the defect seen in achondroplasia is one ofonly a few defects known to increase in frequency withincreasing age of the father (many genetic defects arelinked to increased age of the mother).\\nPeople with achondroplasia have abnormally short\\narms and legs. Their trunk is usually of normal size, as istheir head. The appearance of short limbs and normalhead size actually makes the head appear to be oversized.The bridge of the nose often has a scooped out appear-ance termed “saddle nose.” The lower back has an abnor-mal curvature, or sway back. The face often displays anoverly prominent forehead, and a relative lack of devel-opment of the face in the area of the upper jaw. Becausethe foramen magnum and spinal canal are abnormallynarrowed, nerve damage may occur if the spinal cord ornerves become compressed. The narrowed foramen mag-num may disrupt the normal flow of fluid between thebrain and the spinal cord, resulting in the accumulationof too much fluid in the brain ( hydrocephalus ). Children\\nwith achondroplasia have a very high risk of serious andrepeated middle ear infections, which can result in hear-\\ning loss . The disease does not affect either mental capac-\\nity, or reproductive ability.KEY TERMS\\nCartilage —A flexible, fibrous type of connective tis-\\nsue which serves as a base on which bone is built.\\nForamen magnum —The opening at the base of the\\nskull, through which the spinal cord and the brain-stem pass.\\nHydrocephalus —An abnormal accumulation of\\nfluid within the brain. This accumulation can bedestructive by pressing on brain structures, anddamaging them.\\nMutation —A new, permanent change in the struc-\\nture of a gene, which can result in abnormal struc-ture or function somewhere in the body.\\nSpinal canal —The opening that runs through the\\ncenter of the column of spinal bones (vertebrae),and through which the spinal cord passes.\\nVertebrae —The individual bones of the spinal col-\\numn which are stacked on top of each other. Thereis a hole in the center of each bone, throughwhich the spinal cord passes.Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis is often made at birth due to the characteris-\\ntically short limbs, and the appearance of a large head. X-ray examination will reveal a characteristic appearance tothe bones, with the bones of the limbs appearing short inlength, yet broad in width. A number of measurements ofthe bones in x-ray images will reveal abnormal proportions.\\nTreatment\\nNo treatment will reverse the defect present in achon-\\ndroplasia. All patients with the disease will be short, withabnormally proportioned limbs, trunk, and head. Treat-ment of achondroplasia primarily addresses some of thecomplications of the disorder, including problems due tonerve compression, hydrocephalus, bowed legs, andabnormal curves in the spine. Children with achondropla-sia who develop middle ear infections (acute otitis\\nmedia ) will require quick treatment with antibiotics and\\ncareful monitoring in order to avoid hearing loss.\\nPrognosis\\nAchondroplasia is a disease which causes consider-\\nable deformity. However, with careful attention paid tothe development of dangerous complications (nervecompression, hydrocephalus), most people are in goodhealth, and can live a normal lifespan.\\nPrevention\\nThe only form of prevention is through genetic\\ncounseling , which could help parents assess their risk of\\nhaving a child with achondroplasia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHall, Bryan D. “Achondroplasia.” In Nelson Textbook of Pedi-\\natrics , ed.

Like allenzymes, it is needed to trigger specific chemical reac-tions. Acid phosphatase testing is done to diagnosewhether prostate cancer has spread to other parts of the\\nbody (metastasized), and to check the effectiveness oftreatment. The test has been largely supplanted by theprostate specific antigen test (PSA).\\nPurpose\\nThe male prostate gland has 100 times more acid\\nphosphatase than any other body tissue. When prostatecancer spreads to other parts of the body, acid phos-\\nphatase levels rise, particularly if the cancer spreads tothe bone. One-half to three-fourths of persons who havemetastasized prostate cancer have high acid phosphataselevels. Levels fall after the tumor is removed or reducedthrough treatment.\\nTissues other than prostate have small amounts of\\nacid phosphatase, including bone, liver, spleen, kidney,and red blood cells and platelets. Damage to these tissuescauses a moderate increase in acid phosphatase levels.\\nAcid phosphatase is very concentrated in semen.\\nRape investigations will often include testing for thepresence of acid phosphatase in vaginal fluid.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for prostate cancer. Acid\\nphosphatase levels rise only after prostate cancer hasmetastasized.\\nDescription\\nLaboratory testing measures the amount of acid\\nphosphatase in a person’s blood, and can determine fromwhat tissue the enzyme is coming. For example, it isimportant to know if the increased acid phosphatase isfrom the prostate or red blood cells. Acid phosphatasefrom the prostate, called prostatic acid phosphatase(PAP), is the most medically significant type of acidphosphatase.KEY TERMS\\nEnzyme —A substance needed to trigger specific\\nchemical reactions.\\nMetastasize —Spread to other parts of the body;\\nusually refers to cancer.\\nProstate gland —A gland of the male reproductive\\nsystem.\\nSubtle differences between prostatic acid phos-\\nphatase and acid phosphatases from other tissues causethem to react differently in the laboratory when mixedwith certain chemicals. For example, adding the chemi-cal tartrate to the test mixture inhibits the activity of pro-static acid phosphatase but not red blood cell acid phos-phatase. Laboratory test methods based on these differ-ences reveal how much of a person’s total acid phos-phatase is derived from the prostate. Results are usuallyavailable the next day.\\nPreparation\\nThis test requires drawing about 5-10 mL of blood.\\nThe patient should not have a rectal exam or prostatemassage for two to three days prior to the test.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite, and the person may feel dizzy or faint. Applyingpressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops willreduce bruising. Warm packs to the puncture site willrelieve discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe highest levels of acid phosphatase are found in\\nmetastasized prostate cancer.

It occurs when thepores of the skin become clogged with oil, dead skincells, and bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne, is\\nthe most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17 millionpeople in the United States. While acne can arise at anyage, it usually begins at puberty and worsens during ado-\\nlescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne at some timebetween the ages of 12-25 years. Up to 20% of womendevelop mild acne. It is also found in some newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s sur-\\nface. They produce an oil called sebum, the skin’s naturalmoisturizer. These glands and the hair follicles withinwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.These follicles open onto the skin through pores. Atpuberty, increased levels of androgens (male hormones)cause the glands to produce too much sebum. Whenexcess sebum combines with dead, sticky skin cells, ahard plug, or comedo, forms that blocks the pore. Mildnoninflammatory acne consists of the two types of come-dones, whiteheads and blackheads.\\nModerate and severe inflammatory types of acne\\nresult after the plugged follicle is invaded by Propioni-\\nbacterium acnes , a bacteria that normally lives on theskin. A pimple forms when the damaged follicle weakens\\nand bursts open, releasing sebum, bacteria, and skin andwhite blood cells into the surrounding tissues. Inflamedpimples near the skin’s surface are called papules; whendeeper, they are called pustules. The most severe type ofacne consists of cysts (closed sacs) and nodules (hardswellings). Scarring occurs when new skin cells are laiddown to replace damaged cells.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back since these are the parts of the bodywhere the most sebaceous follicles are found.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is unknown. Several risk\\nfactors have been identified:\\n• Age. Due to the hormonal changes they experience,\\nteenagers are more likely to develop acne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the disease.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstrua-\\ntion, during pregnancy , and menopause .\\n• Diet. No foods cause acne, but certain foods may cause\\nflare-ups.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of drugs including\\ntranquilizers, antidepressants, antibiotics ,oral contra-\\nceptives , and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Abrasive soaps, hard scrubbing, or\\npicking at pimples will make them worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted air,\\nand sweating in hot weather aggravate acne.\\n•Stress . Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\nAcne is usually not conspicuous, although inflamed\\nlesions may cause pain , tenderness, itching , or swelling.\\nThe most troubling aspects of these lesions are the nega-tive cosmetic effects and potential for scarring. Somepeople, especially teenagers, become emotionally upsetabout their condition, and have problems forming rela-tionships or keeping jobs.\\nDiagnosis\\nAcne patients are often treated by family doctors.\\nComplicated cases are referred to a dermatologist, a skin\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 24AcneGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 24'),\n",

The doctor takes a complete medicalhistory, including questions about skin care, diet, factorscausing flare-ups, medication use, and prior treatment.Physical examination includes the face, upper neck,\\nchest, shoulders, back, and other affected areas. Undergood lighting, the doctor determines what types and howmany blemishes are present, whether they are inflamed,whether they are deep or superficial, and whether there isscarring or skin discoloration.\\nIn teenagers, acne is often found on the forehead,\\nnose, and chin. As people get older, acne tends to appeartowards the outer part of the face. Adult women mayhave acne on their chins and around their mouths. Theelderly may develop whiteheads and blackheads on theupper cheeks and skin around the eyes.\\nLaboratory tests are not done unless the patient\\nappears to have a hormonal disorder or other medicalproblem. In this case, blood analyses or other tests maybe ordered. Most insurance plans cover the costs of diag-nosing and treating acne.\\nTreatment\\nAcne treatment consists of reducing sebum produc-\\ntion, removing dead skin cells, and killing bacteria withtopical drugs and oral medications. Treatment choicedepends upon whether the acne is mild, moderate, orsevere.\\nDrugs\\nTOPICAL DRUGS. Treatment for mild noninflamma-\\ntory acne consists of reducing the formation of newcomedones with topical tretinoin, benzoyl peroxide, ada-palene, or salicylic acid. Tretinoin is especially effectivebecause it increases turnover ( death and replacement) of\\nskin cells. When complicated by inflammation, topicalantibiotics may be added to the treatment regimen.Improvement is usually seen in two to four weeks.\\nTopical medications are available as cream, gel,\\nlotion, or pad preparations of varying strengths. Theyinclude antibiotics (agents that kill bacteria), such as ery-thromycin, clindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline(Meclan); comedolytics (agents that loosen hard plugsand open pores) such as the vitamin A acid tretinoin(Retin-A), salicylic acid, adapalene (Differin), resorci-nol, and sulfur. Drugs that act as both comedolytics andantibiotics, such as benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid(Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus erythromycin (Benza-mycin), are also used. These drugs may be used for\\nmonths to years to achieve disease control.\\nAfter washing with mild soap, the drugs are applied\\nalone or in combination, once or twice a day over theentire affected area of skin. Possible side effects includemild redness, peeling, irritation, dryness, and an increasedsensitivity to sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.\\nORAL DRUGS. Oral antibiotics are taken daily for\\ntwo to four months. The drugs used include tetracycline,erythromycin, minocycline (Minocin), doxycycline, clin-damycin (Cleocin), and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole(Bactrim, Septra). Possible side effects include allergicreactions, stomach upset, vaginal yeast infections, dizzi-\\nness, and tooth discoloration.\\nThe goal of treating moderate acne is to decrease\\ninflammation and prevent new comedone formation.

The vestibular and cochlearnerves lie next to one another. They also run along sideother cranial nerves. People possess two of each type ofvestibulocochlear nerve, one that extends from the leftear and one that extends from the right ear.\\nThe vestibular nerve transmits information concern-\\ning balance from the inner ear to the brain and the cochlearnerve transmits information about hearing. The vestibularnerve, like many nerves, is surrounded by a cover called amyelin sheath. A tumor, called a schwannoma, can some-times develop from the cells of the myelin sheath. A tumoris an abnormal growth of tissue that results from theuncontrolled growth of cells. Acoustic neuromas are oftencalled vestibular schwannomas because they are tumorsthat arise from the myelin sheath that surrounds thevestibular nerve. Acoustic neuromas are consideredbenign (non-cancerous) tumors since they do not spread toother parts of the body. They can occur anywhere alongthe vestibular nerve but are most likely to occur where thevestibulocochlear nerve passes through the tiny bony canalthat connects the brain and the inner ear.\\nAn acoustic neuroma can arise from the left vestibu-\\nlar nerve or the right vestibular nerve. A unilateral tumoris a tumor arising from one nerve and a bilateral tumorarises from both vestibular nerves. Unilateral acousticneuromas usually occur spontaneously (by chance).

A person\\nwith NF2 has inherited a predisposition for developingacoustic neuromas and other tumors of the nerve cells.\\nAcoustic neuromas usually grow slowly and can\\ntake years to develop. Some acoustic neuromas remainso small that they do not cause any symptoms. As theacoustic neuroma grows it can interfere with the func-tioning of the vestibular nerve and can cause vertigo andbalance difficulties. If the acoustic nerve grows largeenough to press against the cochlear nerve, then hearing\\nlossand a ringing ( tinnitus ) in the affected ear will usu-\\nally occur. If untreated and the acoustic neuroma contin-ues to grow it can press against other nerves in the regionand cause other symptoms. This tumor can be life threat-ening if it becomes large enough to press against andinterfere with the functioning of the brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAn acoustic neuroma is caused by a change or\\nabsence of both of the NF2 tumor suppressor genes in anerve cell. Every person possesses a pair of NF2 genes inevery cell of their body including their nerve cells. OneNF2 gene is inherited from the egg cell of the mother andone NF2 gene is inherited from the sperm cell of thefather. The NF2 gene is responsible for helping to pre-vent the formation of tumors in the nerve cells. In partic-ular the NF2 gene helps to prevent acoustic neuromas.\\nOnly one unchanged and functioning NF2 gene is\\nnecessary to prevent the formation of an acoustic neuro-ma. If both NF2 genes become changed or missing inone of the myelin sheath cells of the vestibular nervethen an acoustic neuroma will usually develop. Most uni-lateral acoustic neuromas result when the NF2 genesbecome spontaneously changed or missing. Someonewith a unilateral acoustic neuroma that has developedspontaneously is not at increased risk for having childrenwith an acoustic neuroma. Some unilateral acoustic neu-romas result from the hereditary condition NF2. It is alsopossible that some unilateral acoustic neuromas may becaused by changes in other genes responsible for pre-venting the formation of tumors.\\nBilateral acoustic neuromas result when someone is\\naffected with the hereditary condition NF2. A person withNF2 is typically born with one unchanged and onechanged or missing NF2 gene in every cell of their body.Sometimes they inherit this change from their mother orfather. Sometimes the change occurs spontaneously whenthe egg and sperm come together to form the first cell ofthe baby. The children of a person with NF2 have a 50%chance of inheriting the changed or missing NF2 gene.A person with NF2 will develop an acoustic neuro-\\nma if the remaining unchanged NF2 gene becomes spon-taneously changed or missing in one of the myelin sheathcells of their vestibular nerve. People with NF2 oftendevelop acoustic neuromas at a younger age. The meanage of onset of acoustic neuroma in NF2 is 31 years ofage versus 50 years of age for sporadic acoustic neuro-mas. Not all people with NF2, however, develop acousticneuromas. People with NF2 are at increased risk fordeveloping cataracts and tumors in other nerve cells.\\nMost people with a unilateral acoustic neuroma are\\nnot affected with NF2. Some people with NF2, however,only develop a tumor in one of the vestibulocochlearnerves. Others may initially be diagnosed with a unilater-al tumor but may develop a tumor in the other nerve anumber of years later. NF2 should be considered in some-one under the age of 40 who has a unilateral acoustic neu-roma. Someone with a unilateral acoustic neuroma andother family members diagnosed with NF2 probably isaffected with NF2. Someone with a unilateral acousticneuroma and other symptoms of NF2 such as cataractsand other tumors may also be affected with NF2. On theother hand, someone over the age of 50 with a unilateralacoustic neuroma, no other tumors and no family historyof NF2 is very unlikely to be affected with NF2.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall acoustic neuromas usually only interfere with\\nthe functioning of the vestibulocochlear nerve. The mostcommon first symptom of an acoustic neuroma is hearingloss, which is often accompanied by a ringing sound (tin-nitis). People with acoustic neuromas sometimes reportdifficulties in using the phone and difficulties in perceivingthe tone of a musical instrument or sound even when theirhearing appears to be otherwise normal. In most cases thehearing loss is initially subtle and worsens gradually overtime until deafness occurs in the affected ear. In approxi-mately 10% of cases the hearing loss is sudden and severe.\\nAcoustic neuromas can also affect the functioning of\\nthe vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear nerve andvan cause vertigo and dysequilibrium. Twenty percent ofsmall tumors are associated with periodic vertigo, whichis characterized by dizziness or a whirling sensation.\\nLarger acoustic neuromas are less likely to cause vertigobut more likely to cause dysequilibrium. Dysequilibrium,which is characterized by minor clumsiness and a gener-al feeling of instability, occurs in nearly 50% of peoplewith an acoustic neuroma.\\nAs the tumor grows larger it can press on the surround-\\ning cranial nerves. Compression of the fifth cranial nervecan result in facial pain and or numbness.

The brain stem is the stalk like portion of the brainthat joins the spinal cord to the cerebrum, the thinking andreasoning part of the brain. Different parts of the brain-stem have different functions such as the control of breath-ing and muscle coordination.

Duringthe ABR examination, a harmless electrical impulse ispassed from the inner ear to the brainstem. An acousticneuroma can interfere with the passage of this electri-cal impulse and this interference can, sometimes beidentified through the ABR evaluation. A normal ABRexamination does not rule out the possibility of anacoustic neuroma.

Com-\\nputerized tomography (CT scan, CAT scan)is unable toidentify smaller tumors; but it can be used when anacoustic neuroma is suspected and an MRI evaluationcannot be performed.\\nOnce an acoustic neuroma is diagnosed, an evalua-\\ntion by genetic specialists such as a geneticist and genet-ic counselor may be recommended. The purpose of thisevaluation is to obtain a detailed family history andcheck for signs of NF2. If NF2 is strongly suspectedthen DNA testing may be recommended. DNA testinginvolves checking the blood cells obtained from a rou-tine blood draw for the common gene changes associat-ed with NF2.\\nTreatment\\nThe three treatment options for acoustic neuroma\\nare surgery, radiation, and observation. The physicianand patient should discuss the pros and cons of the differ-ent options prior to making a decision about treatment.The patient’s, physical health, age, symptoms, tumorsize, and tumor location should be considered.\\nMicrosurgery\\nThe surgical removal of the tumor or tumors is the\\nmost common treatment for acoustic neuroma. In mostcases the entire tumor is removed during the surgery. Ifthe tumor is large and causing significant symptoms, yetthere is a need to preserve hearing in that ear, then onlypart of the tumor may be removed. During the procedurethe tumor is removed under microscopic guidance andgeneral anesthetic. Monitoring of the neighboring cranialnerves is done during the procedure so that damage tothese nerves can be prevented. If preservation of hearingis a possibility, then monitoring of hearing will also takeplace during the surgery.\\nMost people stay in the hospital four to seven days\\nfollowing the surgery. Total recovery usually takes fourto six weeks. Most people experience fatigue and head\\ndiscomfort following the surgery. Problems with balanceand head and neck stiffness are also common. The mor-tality rate of this type of surgery is less than 2% at mostmajor centers. Approximately 20% of patients experi-ence some degree of post-surgical complications. In mostcases these complications can be managed successfullyand do not result in long term medical problems. Surgerybrings with it a risk of stroke , damage to the brain stem,\\ninfection, leakage of spinal fluid and damage to the cra-nial nerves. Hearing loss and/or tinnitis often result fromthe surgery. A follow-up MRI is recommended one tofive years following the surgery because of possibleregrowth of the tumor.Stereotactic Radiation therapy\\nDuring stereotactic radiation therapy , also called\\nradiosurgery or radiotherapy, many small beams of radia-tion are aimed directly at the acoustic neuroma. The radi-ation is administered in a single large dose, under localanesthetic and is performed on an outpatient basis. Thisresults in a high dose of radiation to the tumor but littleradiation exposure to the surrounding area. This treat-ment approach is limited to small or medium tumors.The goal of the surgery is to cause tumor shrinkage or atleast limit the growth of the tumor. The long term effica-cy and risks of this treatment approach are not known.Periodic MRI monitoring throughout the life of thepatient is therefore recommended.\\nRadiation therapy can cause hearing loss which can\\nsometimes occurs even years later. Radiation therapy canalso cause damage to neighboring cranial nerves, whichcan result in symptoms such as numbness, pain or paralysisof the facial muscles. In many cases these symptoms aretemporary. Radiation treatment can also induce the forma-tion of other benign or malignant schwannomas. This typeof treatment may therefore be contraindicated in the treat-ment of acoustic neuromas in those with NF2 who are pre-disposed to developing schwannomas and other tumors.\\nObservation\\nAcoustic neuromas are usually slow growing and in\\nsome cases they will stop growing and even becomesmaller or disappear entirely. It may therefore be appro-priate in some cases to hold off on treatment and to peri-odically monitor the tumor through MRI evaluations.Long-term observation may be appropriate for examplein an elderly person with a small acoustic neuroma andfew symptoms. Periodic observation may also be indicat-ed for someone with a small and asymptomatic acousticneuroma that was detected through an evaluation foranother medical problem. Observation may also be sug-gested for someone with an acoustic neuroma in the onlyhearing ear or in the ear that has better hearing. The dan-ger of an observational approach is that as the tumorgrows larger it can become more difficult to treat.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for someone with a unilateral acoustic\\nneuroma is usually quite good provided the tumor is diag-nosed early and appropriate treatment is instituted. Longterm hearing loss and tinnitis in the affected ear are com-mon, even if appropriate treatment is provided.

The spasm of the blood vessels decreases theamount of blood that passes through them, resulting in lessblood being delivered to the hands and feet. The hands maybe the main area affected. The affected areas turn blue andbecome cold and sweaty. Localized swelling may also occur.Emotion and cold temperatures can worsen the symptoms,while warmth can decrease symptoms. The disease is seenmainly in women and the effect of the disorder is mainlycosmetic. People with the disease tend to be uncomfortable,with sweaty, cold, bluish colored hands and feet.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe sympathetic nerves cause constriction or spasms\\nin the peripheral blood vessels that supply blood to theextremities. The spasms are a contraction of the musclesin the walls of the blood vessels. The contractiondecreases the internal diameter of the blood vessels,thereby decreasing the amount of blood flow through theaffected area. The spasms occur on a persistent basis,resulting in long term reduction of blood supply to thehands and feet. Sufficient blood still passes through theblood vessels so that the tissue in the affected areas doesnot starve for oxygen or die. Mainly, blood vessels nearthe surface of the skin are affected.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made by observation of the main clini-\\ncal symptoms, including persistently blue and sweatyhands and/or feet and a lack of pain .

This chemical released from the pituitary glandis called growth hormone (GH). The body’s ability toKEY TERMS\\nSympathetic nerve —A nerve of the autonomic\\nnervous system that regulates involuntary andautomatic reactions, especially to stress.process and use nutrients like fats and sugars is also\\naltered. In children whose bony growth plates have notclosed, the chemical changes of acromegaly result inexceptional growth of long bones. This variant is calledgigantism, with the additional bone growth causingunusual height. When the abnormality occurs after bonegrowth stops, the disorder is called acromegaly.\\nDescription\\nAcromegaly is a relatively rare disorder, occurring in\\napproximately 50 out of every one million people (50/1,000,000). Both men and women are affected. Becausethe symptoms of acromegaly occur so gradually, diagno-sis is often delayed. The majority of patients are notidentified until they are middle aged.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe pituitary is a small gland located at the base of\\nthe brain. A gland is a collection of cells that releasescertain chemicals, or hormones, which are important tothe functioning of other organs or body systems. Thepituitary hormones travel throughout the body and areinvolved in a large number of activities, including theregulation of growth and reproductive functions. Thecause of acromegaly can be traced to the pituitary’s pro-duction of GH.\\nUnder normal conditions, the pituitary receives input\\nfrom another brain structure, the hypothalamus, locatedat the base of the brain. This input from the hypothala-mus regulates the pituitary’s release of hormones. Forexample, the hypothalamus produces growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), which directs the pituitaryto release GH. Input from the hypothalamus should alsodirect the pituitary to stop releasing hormones.\\nIn acromegaly, the pituitary continues to release GH\\nand ignores signals from the hypothalamus. In the liver,GH causes production of a hormone called insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is responsible for growththroughout the body. When the pituitary refuses to stopproducing GH, the levels of IGF-1 also reach abnormalpeaks. Bones, soft tissue, and organs throughout the bodybegin to enlarge, and the body changes its ability toprocess and use nutrients like sugars and fats.\\nIn acromegaly, an individual’s hands and feet begin\\nto grow, becoming thick and doughy. The jaw line, nose,and forehead also grow, and facial features are describedas “coarsening”. The tongue grows larger, and becausethe jaw is larger, the teeth become more widely spaced.Due to swelling within the structures of the throat andsinuses, the voice becomes deeper and sounds more hol-low, and patients may develop loud snoring . Various hor-\\nmonal changes cause symptoms such as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 32Acromegaly and gigantismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 32'),\n",

This increase in skin tagsis also associated with the development of growths,called polyps, within the large intestine that may eventu-ally become cancerous. Patients with acromegaly oftensuffer from headaches and arthritis. The variousswellings and enlargements throughout the body maypress on nerves, causing sensations of local tingling orburning, and sometimes result in muscle weakness.\\nThe most common cause of this disorder (in 90% of\\npatients) is the development of a noncancerous tumor with-in the pituitary, called a pituitary adenoma. These tumorsare the source of the abnormal release of GH. As thesetumors grow, they may press on nearby structures within thebrain, causing headaches and changes in vision. As the ade-noma grows, it may disrupt other pituitary tissue, interferingwith the release of other hormones. These disruptions maybe responsible for changes in the menstrual cycle ofwomen, decreases in the sexual drive in men and women,and the abnormal production of breast milk in women. Inrare cases, acromegaly is caused by the abnormal produc-tion of GHRH, which leads to the increased production ofGH. Certain tumors in the pancreas, lungs, adrenal glands,thyroid, and intestine produce GHRH, which in turn triggersproduction of an abnormal quantity of GH.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause acromegaly produces slow changes over\\ntime, diagnosis is often significantly delayed. In fact, thecharacteristic coarsening of the facial features is oftennot recognized by family members, friends, or long-timefamily physicians. Often, the diagnosis is suspected by anew physician who sees the patient for the first time andis struck by the patient’s characteristic facial appearance.Comparing old photographs from a number of differenttime periods will often increase suspicion of the disease.\\nBecause the quantity of GH produced varies widely\\nunder normal conditions, demonstrating high levels ofGH in the blood is not sufficient to merit a diagnosis ofacromegaly. Instead, laboratory tests measuring anincrease of IGF-1 (3-10 times above the normal level) are\\nuseful. These results, however, must be carefully inter-preted because normal laboratory values for IGF-1 varywhen the patient is pregnant, undergoing puberty , elder-\\nly, or severely malnourished. Normal patients will show adecrease in GH production when given a large dose ofsugar (glucose). Patients with acromegaly will not showthis decrease, and will often show an increase in GH pro-duction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful\\nfor viewing the pituitary, and for identifying and locatingan adenoma. When no adenoma can be located, the searchfor a GHRH-producing tumor in another location begins.\\nTreatment\\nThe first step in treatment of acromegaly is removal of\\nall or part of the pituitary adenoma.

The diagnosis ofactinomycosis is based upon several things. The presence of ared lump with draining sinuses on the head or neck is stronglysuggestive of cervicofacial actinomycosis. A recent history oftooth extraction or signs of tooth decay or poor dental\\nhygiene aid in the diagnosis. Microscopic examination of thefluid draining from the sinuses shows the characteristic “sul-fur granules” (small yellow colored material in the fluid) pro-duced by Actinomyces israelii .

For instance, West-ern scientists have trouble with the idea of chi, the invisi-ble energy of the body, and the idea that pressing on cer-tain points can alleviate certain conditions seems some-times too simple for scientists to believe.\\nWestern scientists, in trying to account for the action\\nof acupressure, have theorized that chi is actually part ofthe neuroendocrine system of the body. Celebrated ortho-pedic surgeon Robert O. Becker, who was twice nominatedfor the Nobel Prize, wrote a book on the subject calledCross Currents: The Promise of Electromedicine; The Per-ils of Electropollution . By using precise electrical measur-\\ning devices, Becker and his colleagues showed that thebody has a complex web of electromagnetic energy, andthat traditional acupressure meridians and points containedamounts of energy that non-acupressure points did not.The mechanisms of acupuncture and acupressure\\nremain difficult to document in terms of the biochemicalprocesses involved; numerous testimonials are the prima-ry evidence backing up the effectiveness of acupressureand acupuncture. However, a body of research is growingthat verifies the effectiveness in acupressure andacupuncture techniques in treating many problems and incontrolling pain.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nJarmey, Chris and John Tindall.

Acupuncture is generally most effective\\nwhen used as prevention or before a health conditionbecomes acute, but it has been used to help patients suf-fering from cancer and AIDS . Acupuncture is limited in\\ntreating conditions or traumas that require surgery oremergency care (such as for broken bones).\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nThe original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei\\nChing, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-cine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old.\\nThousands of books since then have been written on thesubject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophiesspread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all ofthe forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the Westtoday, including acupuncture, shiatsu ,acupressure mas-\\nsage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots inChinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture devel-oped when early Chinese physicians observed unpredict-ed effects of puncture wounds in Chinese warriors. The\\noldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic Classic\\nof Acupuncture , dates back to 282 \\nA.D. Although acupunc-\\nture is its best known technique, Chinese medicine tradi-tionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary therapy, lifestylechanges and other means to treat patients.\\nIn the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians\\nwho had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,but outside of Asian-American communities it remainedvirtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixonbecame the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’strip, journalists were amazed to observe major operationsbeing performed on patients without the use of anesthetics.Instead, wide-awake patients were being operated on withonly acupuncture needles inserted into them to controlpain. During that time, a famous columnist for the New\\nYork Times , James Reston, had to undergo surgery and\\nelected to use acupuncture instead of pain medication, andhe wrote some convincing stories on its effectiveness.\\nToday acupuncture is being practiced in all 50 states\\nby over 9,000 practitioners, with over 4,000 MDs includ-ing it in their practices. Acupuncture has shown notablesuccess in treating many conditions, and over 15 millionAmericans have used it as a therapy.

The American Medical Association has beenresistant to researching it, as it is based on concepts verydifferent from the Western scientific model.\\nSeveral forms of acupuncture are being used today in\\nAmerica. Japanese acupuncture uses extremely thin nee-dles and does not incorporate herbal medicine in its prac-tice. Auricular acupuncture uses acupuncture points onlyon the ear, which are believed to stimulate and balanceinternal organs. In France, where acupuncture is very pop-ular and more accepted by the medical establishment, neu-rologist Paul Nogier developed a system of acupuncturebased on neuroendocrine theory rather than on traditionalChinese concepts, which is gaining some use in America.\\nBasic ideas of Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\\nthe universe, and subject to universal laws and principlesof harmony and balance. Chinese medicine does notdraw a sharp line, as Western medicine does, betweenmind and body. The Chinese system believes that emo-tions and mental states are every bit as influential on dis-ease as purely physical mechanisms, and considers fac-tors like work, environment, lifestyle and relationships as\\nfundamental to the overall picture of a patient’s health.Chinese medicine also uses very different symbols andideas to discuss the body and health. While Western med-icine typically describes health in terms of measurablephysical processes made up of chemical reactions, theChinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ sys-tem, and the five elements to describe health and thebody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it isworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-rate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.For example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.In gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yinis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark andyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downwardand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is evercompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.These two principles are always interacting, opposing,and influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-cine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allowthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniouslytogether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 41Acupuncture\\nConception vessel\\nStomach meridian\\nLarge intestine meridian\\nGallbladder meridianGovernor vessel\\nBladder meridian\\nTriple burner meridian\\nSmall intestine meridian\\nAcupuncture sites and meridians on the face and neck.

Thus, acupuncturetherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, orincrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese med-\\nicine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-ble and is found in the environment in the air, water, foodand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital forcethat creates and animates life. We are all born with inher-ited amounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi fromthe food we eat and the air we breathe. The level andquality of a person’s chi also depends on the state ofphysical, mental and emotional balance. Chi travelsthrough the body along channels called meridians .\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-ach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-ney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triplewarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Eachorgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organinteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. Asthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chiwhich can move through the body, and these movethrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinesedoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptomsare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or moreorgans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from oneKEY TERMS\\nAcupressure —Form of massage using acupunc-\\nture points.\\nAuricular acupuncture —Acupuncture using only\\npoints found on the ears.\\nChi—Basic life energy.\\nMeridian —Channel through which chi travels in\\nthe body.\\nMoxibustion —Acupuncture technique which\\nburns the herb moxa or mugwort.\\nTonification —Acupuncture technique for strength-\\nening the body.\\nYin/Yang —Universal characteristics used to des-\\ncribe aspects of the natural world.organ to another. Each organ has a different profile of\\nsymptoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-\\nry is that the world and body are made up of five mainelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-ments are all interconnected, and each element eithergenerates or controls another element. For instance,water controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinesesystem uses elements and organs to describe and treatconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated withwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the twoorgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-ney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fireproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made byacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/orincrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical andmental symptoms, and the above example is a very sim-ple one. Although this system sounds suspect to Westernscientists, some interesting parallels have been observed.For instance, Western medicine has observed that withsevere heart problems, kidney failure often follows, but itstill does not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine,this connection between the two organs has long beenestablished.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the organsystem or chi meridians, and the goal of any remedy ortreatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its innateharmony. Disease can be caused by internal factors likeemotions, external factors like the environment andweather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet, andgerms. However, infection is seen not as primarily aproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in theenergy of the body which is allowing a sickness to occur.In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the same,as each body has its own characteristics of symptoms andbalance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust the flowof chi throughout the organ system, which will strength-en the body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’smedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-tional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-view. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient tofind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, thepulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-eral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. Fromthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns ofsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 42AcupunctureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 42'),\n",

Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-\\nist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or moreof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-ans, there are nearly 2,000 points which can be used inacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-quently used by traditional acupuncturists. During anindividual treatment, one to twenty needles may be used,depending on which meridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-tion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels arebeing treated. Some points barely go beyond superficiallayers of skin, while some acupuncture points require adepth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The needles general-ly do not cause pain. Patients sometimes report pinchingsensations and often pleasant sensations, as the body expe-riences healing. Depending on the problem, the acupunc-turist might spin or move the needles, or even pass a slightelectrical current through some of them. Moxibustion may\\nbe sometimes used, in which an herbal mixture (moxa ormugwort) is either burned like incense on the acupuncturepoint or on the end of the needle, which is believed to stim-ulate chi in a particular way. Also, acupuncturists some-times use cupping , during which small suction cups are\\nplaced on meridian points to stimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies. Some\\npatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clearproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of\\nhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-dles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit toan acupuncturist takes about thirty minutes. The numberof visits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with someconditions improved in one or two sessions and othersrequiring a series of six or more visits over the course ofweeks or months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending on whether\\nthe practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-MDacupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-up vis-its usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement alsovaries widely, depending on the company and state. Regu-lations have been changing often. Some states authorizeMedicaid to cover acupuncture for certain conditions, andsome states have mandated that general coverage pay foracupuncture. Consumers should be aware of the provisionsfor acupuncture in their individual policies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a\\npatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more thanone physician should be consulted. Also, a patient shouldalways feel comfortable and confident that theiracupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.Research and general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept acupunc-\\nture; although more MDs are using it, the American MedicalAssociation does not recognize it as a specialty. The reasonfor this is that the mechanism of acupuncture is difficult toscientifically understand or measure, such as the invisibleenergy of chi in the body. Western medicine, admitting thatacupuncture works in many cases, has theorized that theenergy meridians are actually part of the nervous system andthat acupuncture relieves pain by releasing endorphins, ornatural pain killers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambi-guity in the biochemistry involved, acupuncture continues toshow effectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain toalleviating the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and researchin acupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-tive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is currentlyfunding research in the use of acupuncture for treatingdepression and attention-deficit disorder.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFleischman, Dr. Gary F.

Kidney (or renal) failure occurs when kidney func-tioning becomes impaired. Fluids and toxins begin toaccumulate in the bloodstream. As fluids build up in thebloodstream, the patient with acute kidney failure maybecome puffy and swollen (edematous) in the face, hands,and feet. Their blood pressure typically begins to rise, andthey may experience fatigue and nausea.\\nUnlike chronic kidney failure , which is long term\\nand irreversible, acute kidney failure is a temporary con-dition. With proper and timely treatment, it can typicallybe reversed. Often there is no permanent damage to thekidneys. Acute kidney failure appears most frequently asa complication of serious illness, like heart failure ,l i v e r\\nfailure, dehydration , severe burns , and excessive bleed-\\ning (hemorrhage). It may also be caused by an obstruc-tion to the urinary tract or as a direct result of kidney dis-ease, injury, or an adverse reaction to a medicine.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute kidney failure can be caused by many differ-\\nent illnesses, injuries, and infections. These conditionsfall into three main categories: prerenal ,postrenal , and\\nintrarenal conditions.\\nPrerenal conditions do not damage the kidney, but\\ncan cause diminished kidney function. They are the mostcommon cause of acute renal failure, and include:\\n• dehydration\\n• hemorrhage• septicemia, or sepsis\\n• heart failure\\n• liver failure• burns\\nPostrenal conditions cause kidney failure by obstruct-\\ning the urinary tract. These conditions include:\\n• inflammation of the prostate gland in men (prostatitis)\\n• enlargement of the prostate gland (benign prostatic\\nhypertrophy)\\n• bladder or pelvic tumors\\n•kidney stones (calculi)Intrarenal conditions involve kidney disease or\\ndirect injury to the kidneys. These conditions include:\\n• lack of blood supply to the kidneys (ischemia)\\n• use of radiocontrast agents in patients with kidney\\nproblems\\n• drug abuse or overdose• long-term use of nephrotoxic medications, like certain\\npain medicines\\n• acute inflammation of the glomeruli, or filters, of the\\nkidney ( glomerulonephritis )\\n• kidney infections (pyelitis or pyelonephritis)\\nCommon symptoms of acute kidney failure include:\\n• anemia. The kidneys are responsible for producing ery-\\nthropoietin (EPO), a hormone that stimulates red bloodcell production. If kidney disease causes shrinking ofthe kidney, red blood cell production is reduced, lead-ing to anemia.\\n• bad breath or bad taste in mouth. Urea in the saliva may\\ncause an ammonia-like taste in the mouth.\\n• bone and joint problems. The kidneys produce vitamin\\nD, which helps the body absorb calcium and keepsbones strong. For patients with kidney failure, bonesmay become brittle. In children, normal growth may bestunted. Joint pain may also occur as a result of highphosphate levels in the blood. Retention of uric acidmay cause gout .\\n• edema. Puffiness or swelling in the arms, hands, feet,\\nand around the eyes.\\n• frequent urination.\\n• foamy or bloody urine. Protein in the urine may cause it\\nto foam significantly. Blood in the urine may indicatebleeding from diseased or obstructed kidneys, bladder,or ureters.\\n• headaches. High blood pressure may trigger headaches.\\n• hypertension, or high blood pressure. The retention of\\nfluids and wastes causes blood volume to increase. Thismakes blood pressure rise.\\n• increased fatigue. Toxic substances in the blood and the\\npresence of anemia may cause the patient to feelexhausted.\\n• itching. Phosphorus, normally eliminated in the urine,\\naccumulates in the blood of patients with kidney failure.An increased phosphorus level may cause the skin to itch.\\n• lower back pain.

A nephrolo-\\ngist, a doctor that specializes in the kidney, may be con-sulted to confirm the diagnosis and recommend treat-ment options. The patient that is suspected of havingacute kidney failure will have blood and urine tests todetermine the level of kidney function. A blood test willassess the levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen(BUN), uric acid, phosphate, sodium, and potassium.The kidney regulates these agents in the blood. Urinesamples will also be collected, usually over a 24-hourperiod, to assess protein loss and/or creatinine clearance.\\nDetermining the cause of kidney failure is critical to\\nproper treatment. A full assessment of the kidneys is neces-sary to determine if the underlying disease is treatable and ifthe kidney failure is chronic or acute. X rays, magnetic res-\\nonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scan (CT),\\nultrasound, renal biopsy, and/or arteriogram of the kidneysmay be used to determine the cause of kidney failure andlevel of remaining kidney function. X rays and ultrasoundof the bladder and/or ureters may also be needed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for acute kidney failure varies. Treatment\\nis directed to the underlying, primary medical conditionthat has triggered kidney failure. Prerenal conditions maybe treated with replacement fluids given through a vein,diuretics , blood transfusion , or medications. Postrenal\\nconditions and intrarenal conditions may require surgeryand/or medication.\\nFrequently, patients in acute kidney failure require\\nhemodialysis ,hemofiltration , or peritoneal dialysis to fil-\\nter fluids and wastes from the bloodstream until the pri-mary medical condition can be controlled.\\nHemodialysis\\nHemodialysis involves circulating the patient’s\\nblood outside of the body through an extracorporeal cir-cuit (ECC), or dialysis circuit. The ECC is made up ofplastic blood tubing, a filter known as a dialyzer (or arti-ficial kidney), and a dialysis machine that monitors andmaintains blood flow and administers dialysate.Dialysate is a sterile chemical solution that is used todraw waste products out of the blood. The patient’s bloodleaves the body through the vein and travels through theECC and the dialyzer, where fluid removal takes place.\\nDuring dialysis, waste products in the bloodstream\\nare carried out of the body. At the same time, electrolytesand other chemicals are added to the blood. The purified,chemically-balanced blood is then returned to the body.KEY TERMS\\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN) —A waste product that\\nis formed in the liver and collects in the blood-stream; patients with kidney failure have highBUN levels.\\nCreatinine —A protein produced by muscle that\\nhealthy kidneys filter out.\\nExtracorporeal —Outside of, or unrelated to, the\\nbody.\\nIschemia —A lack of blood supply to an organ or\\ntissue.\\nNephrotoxic —Toxic, or damaging, to the kidney.\\nRadiocontrast agents —Dyes administered to a\\npatient for the purposes of a radiologic study.\\nSepsis —A bacterial infection of the bloodstream.\\nVasopressors —Medications that constrict the blood\\nvessels.\\nA dialysis “run” typically lasts three to four hours,\\ndepending on the type of dialyzer used and the physicalcondition of the patient. Dialysis is used several times aweek until acute kidney failure is reversed.\\nBlood pressure changes associated with hemodialy-\\nsis may pose a risk for patients with heart problems. Peri-toneal dialysis may be the preferred treatment option inthese cases.\\nHemofiltration\\nHemofiltration, also called continuous renal replace-\\nment therapy (CRRT), is a slow, continuous blood filtra-tion therapy used to control acute kidney failure in criti-cally ill patients. These patients are typically very sickand may have heart problems or circulatory problems.They cannot handle the rapid filtration rates of hemodial-ysis. They also frequently need antibiotics ,nutrition ,\\nvasopressors, and other fluids given through a vein totreat their primary condition. Because hemofiltration iscontinuous, prescription fluids can be given to patients inkidney failure without the risk of fluid overload.\\nLike hemodialysis, hemofiltration uses an ECC. A\\nhollow fiber hemofilter is used instead of a dialyzer toremove fluids and toxins. Instead of a dialysis machine, ablood pump makes the blood flow through the ECC. Thevolume of blood circulating through the ECC in hemofil-tration is less than that in hemodialysis. Filtration ratesare slower and gentler on the circulatory system.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 45Acute kidney failureGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 45'),\n",

Inperitoneal dialysis (PD), the lining of the patient’sabdomen, the peritoneum, acts as a blood filter. A flexibletube-like instrument (catheter) is surgically inserted intothe patient’s abdomen. During treatment, the catheter isused to fill the abdominal cavity with dialysate. Wasteproducts and excess fluids move from the patient’s blood-stream into the dialysate solution. After a certain timeperiod, the waste-filled dialysate is drained from theabdomen, and replaced with clean dialysate. There arethree type of peritoneal dialysis, which vary according totreatment time and administration method.\\nPeritoneal dialysis is often the best treatment option\\nfor infants and children. Their small size can make veinaccess difficult to maintain. It is not recommended forpatients with abdominal adhesions or other abdominaldefects (like a hernia ) that might reduce the efficiency of\\nthe treatment. It is also not recommended for patientswho suffer frequent bouts of an inflammation of thesmall pouches in the intestinal tract (diverticulitis).\\nPrognosis\\nBecause many of the illnesses and underlying con-\\nditions that often trigger acute kidney failure are critical,the prognosis for these patients many times is not good.Studies have estimated overall death rates for acute kid-\\nney failure at 42-88%. Many people, however, diebecause of the primary disease that has caused the kid-ney failure. These figures may also be misleadingbecause patients who experience kidney failure as aresult of less serious illnesses (like kidney stones ordehydration) have an excellent chance of completerecovery. Early recognition and prompt, appropriatetreatment are key to patient recovery.\\nUp to 10% of patients who experience acute kidney\\nfailure will suffer irreversible kidney damage. They willeventually go on to develop chronic kidney failure orend-stage renal disease. These patients will require long-term dialysis or kidney transplantation to replace their\\nlost renal functioning.\\nPrevention\\nSince acute kidney failure can be caused by many\\nthings, prevention is difficult.

This is a potentially seri-ous infection which can rapidly spread to the blood-stream and be fatal.\\nDescription\\nAcute lymphangitis affects a critical member of the\\nimmune system—the lymphatic system. Waste materialsfrom nearly every organ in the body drain into the lym-phatic vessels and are filtered in small organs calledlymph nodes. Foreign bodies, such as bacteria or viruses,are processed in the lymph nodes to generate an immuneresponse to fight an infection.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 46Acute lymphangitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 46'),\n",

Once the bacteria enter the lymphaticsystem, they multiply rapidly and follow the lymphaticvessel like a highway. The infected lymphatic vesselbecomes inflamed, causing red streaks that are visiblebelow the skin surface. The growth of the bacteria occursso rapidly that the immune system does not respond fastenough to stop the infection.\\nIf left untreated, the bacteria can cause tissue\\ndestruction in the area of the infection. A pus-filled,painful lump called an abscess may be formed in the\\ninfected area. Cellulitis , a generalized infection of the\\nlower skin layers, may also occur. In addition, the bacte-ria may invade the bloodstream and cause septicemia.Lay people, for that reason, often call the red streaks seenin the skin “blood poisoning.” Septicemia is a very seri-ous illness and may be fatal.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute lymphangitis is most often caused by the bac-\\nterium Streptococcus pyogenes . This potentially danger-\\nous bacterium also causes strep throat , infections of the\\nheart, spinal cord, and lungs, and in the 1990s has beencalled the “flesh-eating bacterium.” Staphylococci bacte-ria may also cause lymphangitis.\\nAlthough anyone can develop lymphangitis, some\\npeople are more at risk. People who have had radical mas-\\ntectomy (removal of a breast and nearby lymph nodes), a\\nleg vein removed for coronary bypass surgery, or recurrentlymphangitis caused by tinea pedis (a fungal infection onthe foot) are at an increased risk for lymphangitis.\\nThe characteristic symptoms of acute lymphangitis\\nare the wide, red streaks which travel from the site ofinfection to the armpit or groin. The affected areas are red,swollen, and painful. Blistering of the affected skin mayoccur. The bacterial infection causes a fever of 100-104°F\\n(38°–40°C). In addition, a general ill feeling, muscleaches, headache , chills, and loss of appetite may be felt.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf lymphangitis is suspected, the person should call\\nhis or her doctor immediately or go to an emergencyroom. Acute lymphangitis could be diagnosed by thefamily doctor, infectious disease specialist, or an emer-gency room doctor. The painful, red streaks just belowthe skin surface and the high fever are diagnostic of acutelymphangitis.

Diagnosis is\\nimmediate because it is based primarily on the symp-toms. Most insurance policies should cover the expensesfor the diagnosis and treatment of acute lymphangitis.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the serious nature of this infection, treat-\\nment would begin immediately even before the bacterialculture results were available. The only treatment foracute lymphangitis is to give very large doses of anantibiotic, usually penicillin, through the vein. Growingstreptococcal bacteria are usually eliminated rapidly andeasily by penicillin. The antibiotic clindamycin may beincluded in the treatment to kill any streptococci whichare not growing and are in a resting state. Alternatively, a“broad spectrum” antibiotic may be used which wouldkill many different kinds of bacteria.\\nAspirin or other medications which reduce the pain\\nand the fever may also be given. Medications whichreduce any inflammation of the infected region may alsobe provided. The patient is likely to be hospitalized toadminister the antibiotic and other medications and toclosely monitor his or her condition. Surgical drainage ofan abscess may be necessary.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery is expected if antibiotic treatment\\nis begun at an early stage of the infection. However, ifuntreated, acute lymphangitis can be a very serious andeven deadly disease. Acute lymphangitis that goes untreat-ed can spread, causing tissue damage.

Antigens from the dead streptococciclump together with the antibodies that killed them.These clumps are trapped in the kidney tubules, cause thetubules to become inflamed, and impair that organs’ abil-ity to filter and eliminate body wastes. The onset ofAPSGN usually occurs one to six weeks (average twoweeks) after the streptococcal infection.\\nAPSGN is a relatively uncommon disease affecting\\nabout one of every 10,000 people, although four or fivetimes that many may actually be affected by it but showno symptoms. APSGN is most prevalent among boysbetween the ages of 3 and 7, but it can occur at any age.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nFrequent sore throats and a history of streptococcal\\ninfection increase the risk of acquiring APSGN. Symp-toms of APSGN include:\\n• fluid accumulation and tissue swelling ( edema ) initial-\\nly in the face and around the eyes, later in the legs\\n• low urine output (oliguria)• blood in the urine (hematuria)\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)\\n• high blood pressure• joint pain or stiffnessDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of APSGN is made by taking the patient’s\\nhistory, assessing his/her symptoms, and performing cer-tain laboratory tests. Urinalysis usually shows blood and\\nprotein in the urine. Concentrations of urea and creati-nine (two waste products normally filtered out of theblood by the kidneys) in the blood are often high, indi-cating impaired kidney function. A reliable, inexpensiveblood test called the anti-streptolysin-O test can confirmthat a patient has or has had a streptococcal infection. Athroat culture may also show the presence of group A\\nbeta-hemolytic streptococci.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of ASPGN is designed to relieve the\\nsymptoms and prevent complications. Some patients areadvised to stay in bed until they feel better and to restrictfluid and salt intake. Antibiotics may be prescribed to\\nkill any lingering streptococcal bacteria, if their presenceis confirmed. Antihypertensives may be given to helpcontrol high blood pressure and diuretics may be used to\\nreduce fluid retention and swelling. Kidney dialysis is\\nrarely needed.\\nPrognosis\\nMost children (up to 95%) fully recover from\\nAPSGN in a matter of weeks or months. Most adults (upto 70%) also recover fully.

The term hasbeen partially replaced by the word dependence for sub-\\nstance abuse. Addiction has been extended, however, toinclude mood-altering behaviors or activities. Someresearchers speak of two types of addictions: substanceaddictions (for example, alcoholism , drug abuse, and\\nsmoking ); and process addictions (for example, gam-\\nbling, spending, shopping, eating, and sexual activity).There is a growing recognition that many addicts, such aspolydrug abusers, are addicted to more than one sub-stance or process.\\nDescription\\nAddiction is one of the most costly public health\\nproblems in the United States. It is a progressive syn-drome, which means that it increases in severity overtime unless it is treated. Substance abuse is characterizedby frequent relapse, or return to the abused substance.Substance abusers often make repeated attempts to quitbefore they are successful.\\nIn 1995 the economic cost of substance abuse in the\\nUnited States exceeded $414 billion, with health carecosts attributed to substance abuse estimated at morethan $114 billion.\\nBy eighth grade, 52% of adolescents have consumed\\nalcohol, 41% have smoked tobacco, and 20% havesmoked marijuana. Compared to females, males arealmost four times as likely to be heavy drinkers, nearlyone and a half more likely to smoke a pack or more ofcigarettes daily, and twice as likely to smoke marijuanaweekly. However, among adolescents these gender dif-ferences are decreasing. Although frequent use of tobac-co,cocaine and heavy drinking appears to have remained\\nstable in the 1990s, marijuana use increased.\\nIn 1999, an estimated four million Americans over the\\nage of 12 used prescription pain relievers, sedatives, and\\nstimulants for “nonmedical” reasons during one month.\\nIn the United States, 25% of the population regularly\\nuses tobacco. Tobacco use reportedly kills 2.5 times asmany people each year as alcohol and drug abuse com-bined. According to 1998 data from the World HealthOrganization, there were 1.1 billion smokers worldwideand 10,000 tobacco-related deaths per day. Furthermore,in the United States, 43% of children aged 2-11 years areexposed to environmental tobacco smoke, which hasbeen implicated in sudden infant death syndrome ,l o w\\nbirth weight, asthma , middle ear disease, pneumonia ,\\ncough , and upper respiratory infection.\\nEating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa ,bulim-\\nia nervosa , and binge eating, affect over five million\\nAmerican women and men. Fifteen percent of youngwomen have substantially disordered attitudes towardeating and eating behaviors. More than 1,000 women dieeach year from anorexia nervosa.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 50AddictionGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 50'),\n",

Some forms of substance abuse and\\ndependence seem to run in families; and this may be the\\nresult of a genetic predisposition, environmental influ-ences, or a combination of both.\\nBrain structure and function\\nUsing drugs repeatedly over time changes brain\\nstructure and function in fundamental and long-lastingways. Addiction comes about through an array ofchanges in the brain and the strengthening of new memo-ry connections. Evidence suggests that those long-lastingbrain changes are responsible for the distortions of cog-nitive and emotional functioning that characterizeaddicts, particularly the compulsion to use drugs.Although the causes of addiction remain the subject ofongoing debate and research, many experts now consideraddiction to be a brain disease: a condition caused bypersistent changes in brain structure and function. How-ever, having this brain disease does not absolve theaddict of responsibility for his or her behavior, but it doesexplain why many addicts cannot stop using drugs bysheer force of will alone.\\nSocial learning\\nSocial learning is considered the most important sin-\\ngle factor. It includes patterns of use in the addict’s fami-ly or subculture, peer pressure, and advertising or mediainfluence.\\nAvailability\\nInexpensive or readily available tobacco, alcohol, or\\ndrugs produce marked increases in rates of addiction.Individual development\\nBefore the 1980s, the so-called addictive personality\\nwas used to explain the development of addiction. Theaddictive personality was described as escapist, impul-sive, dependent, devious, manipulative, and self-cen-tered. Many doctors now believe that these charactertraits develop in addicts as a result of the addiction,rather than the traits being a cause of the addiction.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn addition to a preoccupation with using and\\nacquiring the abused substance, the diagnosis of addic-tion is based on five criteria:\\n• loss of willpower\\n• harmful consequences\\n• unmanageable lifestyle• tolerance or escalation of use• withdrawal symptoms upon quitting\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 51Addiction\\nCrack users.

The number of visits to 12-step self-helpgroups exceeds the number of visits to all mental healthprofessionals combined. There are twelve-step groupsfor all major substance and process addictions.\\nThe Twelve Steps are:\\n• Admit powerlessness over the addiction.• Believe that a Power greater than oneself could restore\\nsanity.\\n• Make a decision to turn your will and your life over to\\nthe care of God, as you understand him.\\n• Make a searching and fearless moral inventory of self.\\n• Admit to God, yourself, and another human being the\\nexact nature of your wrongs.\\n• Become willing to have God remove all these defects\\nfrom your character.\\n• Humbly ask God to remove shortcomings.• Make a list of all persons harmed by your wrongs and\\nbecome willing to make amends to them all.\\n• Make direct amends to such people, whenever possible\\nexcept when to do so would injure them or others.\\n• Continue to take personal inventory and promptly\\nadmit any future wrongdoings.\\n• Seek to improve contact with a God of the individual’s\\nunderstanding through meditation and prayer.\\n• Carry the message of spiritual awakening to others and\\npractice these principles in all your affairs.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAcupuncture and homeopathy have been used to\\ntreat withdrawal symptoms.

This results in decreased production of twoimportant chemicals (hormones) normally released bythe adrenal cortex: cortisol and aldosterone.\\nDescription\\nThe adrenals are two glands, each perched on the\\nupper part of the two kidneys. The outer part of the glandis known as the cortex; the inner part is known as themedulla. Each of these parts of the adrenal gland isresponsible for producing different types of hormones.\\nCortisol is a very potent hormone produced by the\\nadrenal cortex. It is involved in regulating the functioningof nearly every type of organ and tissue throughout thebody, and is considered to be one of the few hormonesabsolutely necessary for life. Cortisol is involved in:\\n• the very complex processing and utilization of many nutri-\\nents, including sugars (carbohydrates), fats, and proteins\\n• the normal functioning of the circulatory system and\\nthe heartKEY TERMS\\nGland —A collection of cells whose function is to\\nrelease certain chemicals, or hormones, which areimportant to the functioning of other, sometimesdistantly located, organs or body systems.\\nHormone —A chemical produced in one part of\\nthe body, which travels to another part of the bodyin order to exert its effect.\\n• the functioning of muscles\\n• normal kidney function\\n• production of blood cells• the normal processes involved in maintaining the skele-\\ntal system\\n• proper functioning of the brain and nerves\\n• the normal responses of the immune system\\nAldosterone, also produced by the adrenal cortex,\\nplays a central role in maintaining the appropriate pro-portions of water and salts in the body. When this bal-ance is upset, the volume of blood circulating throughoutthe body will fall dangerously low, accompanied by adrop in blood pressure.\\nAddison’s disease is also called primary adrenocorti-\\ncal insufficiency. In other words, some process interferesdirectly with the ability of the adrenal cortex to produceits hormones. Levels of both cortisol and aldosteronedrop, and numerous functions throughout the body aredisrupted.\\nAddison’s disease occurs in about four in every\\n100,000 people. It strikes both men and women of all ages.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of Addison’s disease is the\\ndestruction and/or shrinking (atrophy) of the adrenalcortex. In about 70% of all cases, this atrophy isbelieved to occur due to an autoimmune disorder. In anautoimmune disorder, the immune system of the body,responsible for identifying foreign invaders such asviruses or bacteria and killing them, accidentally beginsto identify the cells of the adrenal cortex as foreign, anddestroy them. In about 20% of all cases, destruction ofthe adrenal cortex is caused by tuberculosis . The\\nremaining cases of Addison’s disease may be caused byfungal infections, such as histoplasmosis , coccidiomy-\\ncosis, and cryptococcosis , which affect the adrenal\\ngland by producing destructive, tumor-like masses\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 53Addison’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 53'),\n",

As thedisease progresses, the patient may appear to have verytanned, or bronzed skin, with darkening of the lining ofthe mouth, vagina, and rectum, and dark pigmentationof the area around the nipples (aereola). As dehydrationbecomes more severe, the blood pressure will continueto drop and the patient will feel increasingly weak andlight-headed. Some patients have psychiatric symp-toms, including depression and irritability. Women losepubic and underarm hair, and stop having normal men-strual periods.\\nWhen a patient becomes ill with an infection, or\\nstressed by an injury, the disease may suddenly andrapidly progress, becoming life-threatening. Symptomsof this “Addisonian crisis” include abnormal heartrhythms, severe pain in the back and abdomen, uncon-trollable nausea and vomiting , a drastic drop in blood\\npressure, kidney failure, and unconsciousness. About25% of all Addison’s disease patients are identified dueto the development of Addisonian crisis.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany patients do not recognize the slow progres-\\nsion of symptoms and the disease is ultimately identifiedwhen a physician notices the areas of increased pigmen-tation of the skin. Once suspected, a number of bloodtests can lead to the diagnosis of Addison’s disease. It isnot sufficient to demonstrate low blood cortisol levels,as normal levels of cortisol vary quite widely. Instead,patients are given a testing dose of another hormonecalled corticotropin (ACTH). ACTH is produced in thebody by the pituitary gland, and normally acts by pro-moting growth within the adrenal cortex and stimulatingthe production and release of cortisol. In Addison’s dis-ease, even a dose of synthetic ACTH does not increasecortisol levels.\\nTo distinguish between primary adrenocortical\\ninsufficiency (Addison’s disease) and secondaryadrenocortical insufficiency (caused by failure of thepituitary to produce enough ACTH), levels of ACTH in\\nthe blood are examined. Normal or high levels ofACTH indicate that the pituitary is working properly,but the adrenal cortex is not responding normally to thepresence of ACTH. This confirms the diagnosis ofAddison’s disease.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of Addison’s disease involves replacing\\nthe missing or low levels of cortisol. In the case of Addis-onian crisis, this will be achieved by injecting a potentform of steroid preparation through a needle placed in avein (intravenous or IV). Dehydration and salt loss willalso be treated by administering carefully balanced solu-tions through the IV . Dangerously low blood pressuremay require special medications to safely elevate it untilthe steroids take effect.\\nPatients with Addison’s disease will need to take a\\nsteroid preparation (hydrocortisone) and a replacementfor aldosterone (fludrocortisone) by mouth for the rest oftheir lives. When a patient has an illness which causesnausea and vomiting (such that they cannot hold downtheir medications), he or she will need to enter a medicalfacility where IV medications can be administered.When a patient has any kind of infection or injury, thenormal dose of hydrocortisone will need to be doubled.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis for patients appropriately treated with\\nhydrocortisone and aldosterone is excellent. Thesepatients can expect to enjoy a normal lifespan. Withouttreatment, or with substandard treatment, patients arealways at risk of developing Addisonian crisis.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nWilliams, Gordon H., and Robert G.

The tonsilsbelow are clearly visible behind the back teeth; the ade-noids lie just above them and are hidden from view by thepalate. Together these four arsenals of immune defenseguard the major entrance to the body from foreigninvaders—the germs we breathe and eat. In contrast to therest of the body’s tissues, lymphoid tissue reaches itsgreatest size in mid-childhood and recedes thereafter. Inthis way children are best able to develop the immunitiesthey need to survive in a world full of infectious diseases.\\nBeyond its normal growth pattern, lymphoid tissue\\ngrows excessively (hypertrophies) during an acute infec-tion, as it suddenly increases its immune activity to fightoff the invaders. Often it does not completely return to itsformer size. Each subsequent infection leaves behind alarger set of tonsils and adenoids. To make mattersworse, the sponge-like structure of these hypertrophiedglands can produce safe havens for germs where thebody cannot reach and eliminate them. Before antibi-\\notics and the reduction in infectious childhood diseases\\nover the past few generations, tonsils and adenoidscaused greater health problems.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost tonsil and adenoid hypertrophy is simply\\ncaused by the normal growth pattern for that type of tis-sue. Less often, the hypertrophy is due to repeated throatinfections by cold viruses, strep throat , mononucleosis,\\nand in times gone by, diphtheria . The acute infections\\nare usually referred to as tonsillitis , the adenoids getting\\nlittle recognition because they cannot be seen withoutspecial instruments. Symptoms include painful, brightred, often ulcerated tonsils, enlargement of lymph nodes(glands) beneath the jaw, fever , and general discomfort.\\nAfter the acute infection subsides, symptoms are gen-\\nerated simply by the size of the glands. Extremely largetonsils can impair breathing and swallowing, although thatis quite rare. Large adenoids can impair nose breathingand require a child to breathe through the mouth. Becausethey encircle the only connection between the middle earand the eustachian tube, hypertrophied adenoids can alsoobstruct it and cause middle ear infections.KEY TERMS\\nEustacian tube —A tube connecting the middle ear\\nwith the back of the nose, allowing air pressure toequalize within the ear whenever it opens, such aswith yawning.\\nHyperplastic —Overgrown.\\nHypertrophy —Overgrowth.\\nStrep throat —An infection of the throat caused by\\nbacteria of the Streptococcus family, which causes\\ntonsillitis.\\nUlcerated —Damaged so that the surface tissue is\\nlost and/or necrotic (dead).\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple tongue blade depressing the tongue allows\\nan adequate view of the tonsils. Enlarged tonsils mayhave deep pockets (crypts) containing dead tissue(necrotic debris). Viewing adenoids requires a small mir-ror or fiberoptic scope. A child with recurring middle earinfections may well have large adenoids. A throat cul-\\nture or mononucleosis test will usually reveal the identi-\\nty of the germ.\\nTreatment\\nIt used to be standard practice to remove tonsils\\nand/or adenoids after a few episodes of acute throat or earinfection. The surgery is called tonsillectomy and ade-\\nnoidectomy (T and A). Opinion changed as it was realized\\nthat this tissue is beneficial to the development of immuni-ty. For instance, children without tonsils and adenoids pro-duce only half the immunity to oral polio vaccine. In addi-\\ntion, treatment of ear and throat infections with antibioticsand of recurring ear infections with surgical drainagethrough the ear drum (tympanostomy) has greatly reducedthe incidence of surgical removal of these lymph glands.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are many botanical/herbal remedies that can\\nbe used alone or in formulas to locally assist the tonsilsand adenoids in their immune function at the opening ofthe oral cavity and to tone these glands.

About 47 dif-\\nferent types have been identified since then, and abouthalf of them are believed to cause human diseases. Infantsand children are most commonly affected by adenovirus-es. Adenovirus infections can occur throughout the year,but seem to be most common from fall to spring.\\nAdenoviruses are responsible for 3-5% of acute res-\\npiratory infections in children and 2% of respiratory ill-nesses in civilian adults. They are more apt to causeinfection among military recruits and other young peoplewho live in institutional environments. Outbreaks amongchildren are frequently reported at boarding schools andsummer camps.\\nAcquired immunity\\nMost children have been infected by at least one\\nadenovirus by the time they reach school age. Mostadults have acquired immunity to multiple adenovirustypes due to infections they had as children.\\nIn one mode of adenovirus infection (called lytic\\ninfection because it destroys large numbers of cells), ade-noviruses kill healthy cells and replicate up to one mil-lion new viruses per cell killed (of which 1-5% are infec-tious). People with this kind of infection feel sick. Inchronic or latent infection, a much smaller number ofviruses are released and healthy cells can multiply morerapidly than they are destroyed. People who have thiskind of infection don’t seem to be sick. This is probablywhy many adults have immunity to adenoviruses withoutrealizing they have been infected.\\nChildhood infections\\nIn children, adenoviruses most often cause acute\\nupper respiratory infections with fever and runny nose.\\nAdenovirus types 1, 2, 3,5, and 6 are responsible formost of these infections. Occasionally more seriouslower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia , may\\noccur.\\nAdenoviruses also cause acute pharyngoconjunctival\\nfever in children. This disease is most often caused bytypes 3 and 7. Symptoms, which appear suddenly andusually disappear in less than a week, include:\\n• inflammation of the lining of the eyelid (conjunctivitis)\\n•f e v e r\\n•sore throat (pharyngitis)\\n• runny nose\\n• inflammation of lymph glands in the neck (cervical\\nadenitis)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 56Adenovirus infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 56'),\n",

Achild who has hemorrhagic cystitis has bloody urine forabout three days, and invisible traces of blood can befound in the urine a few days longer. The child will feelthe urge to urinate frequently—but find it difficult to doso—for about the same length of time.\\nAdult infections\\nIn adults, the most frequently reported adenovirus\\ninfection is acute respiratory disease (ARD, caused bytypes 4 and 7) in military recruits. Influenza-like symp-toms including fever, sore throat, runny nose, and cough\\nare almost always present; weakness, chills, headache ,\\nand swollen lymph glands in the neck may also occur.The symptoms typically last three to five days.\\nEpidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC, caused by ade-\\nnovirus types 8, 19, and 37) was first seen in shipyardworkers whose eyes had been slightly injured by chips ofrust or paint.

The stressful event can be anything:it might be just one isolated incident, or a string of prob-lems that wears the person down. The stress might be any-\\nthing from a car accident or illness, to a divorce, or even acertain time of year (such as Christmas or summer).\\nPeople with adjustment disorder may have a wide\\nvariety of symptoms.

They may also develop a deeper voice, a moreprominent Adam’s apple, and other masculine signs.\\nDiagnosis\\nEndocrinologists, doctors who specialize in the\\ndiagnosis and treatment of glandular disorders, have themost expertise to deal with adrenal virilization. SomeKEY TERMS\\nGlucocorticoid —A hormone produced by the\\nadrenal gland; this hormone leads to an increasein blood sugar and creation of sugar molecules bythe liver.\\nHydrocortisone —A hormone in the group of glu-\\ncocorticoid hormones.\\nPrednisone —A drug that functions as a glucocorti-\\ncoid hormone.doctors who treat disorders of the internal organs\\n(internists) and doctors who specialize in treating thereproductive system of women (gynecologists) may alsobe able to help patients with this disorder.\\nDiagnosis involves performing many laboratory\\ntests on blood samples from the patient. These tests mea-sure the concentration of different hormones. Differentabnormalities of the adrenal gland produce a differentpattern of hormonal abnormalities. These tests can alsohelp determine if the problem is adrenal or ovarian. If atumor is suspected, special x rays may be done to visual-ize the tumor in the body. Final diagnosis may depend onobtaining a tissue sample from the tumor (biopsy), andexamining it under a microscope in order to verify itscharacteristics.\\nTreatment\\nAdrenal virilism caused by adrenal hyperplasia is\\ntreated with daily doses of a glucocorticoid. Usuallyprednisone is the drug of choice, but in infants hydrocor-tisone is usually given. Laboratory tests are usually need-ed from time to time to adjust the dosage. Girls withpseudohermaphrodism may require surgery to make theirexternal sex organs appear more normal. If a tumor iscausing the disorder, the treatment will depend on thetype and location of the tumor. Information about thetumor cell type and the spread of the tumor is used todecide the best kind of treatment for a particular patient.If the tumor is cancerous, the patient will require specialtreatment depending on how far the cancer has\\nadvanced. Treatment can be a combination of surgery,medications used to kill cancer cells ( chemotherapy ),\\nand x rays or other high energy rays used to kill cancercells ( radiation therapy ). Sometimes the doctor must\\nremove the adrenal gland and the surrounding tissues. Ifthe tumor is benign, then surgically removing the tumormay be the best option.\\nPrognosis\\nOngoing glucocorticoid treatment usually controls\\nadrenal virilism in cases of adrenal hyperplasia, but thereis no cure. If a cancerous tumor has caused the disorder,patients have a better prognosis if they have an early stageof cancer that is diagnosed quickly and has not spread.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

Lampert\\nAdrenalectomy\\nDefinition\\nAdrenalectomy is the surgical removal of one or\\nboth of the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are pairedendocrine glands, one located above each kidney, thatproduce hormones such as epinephrine, norepinephrine,androgens, estrogens, aldosterone, and cortisol. Adrena-lectomy is usually performed by conventional (open)surgery, but in selected patients surgeons may uselaparoscopy . With laparoscopy, adrenalectomy can be\\naccomplished through four very small incisions.\\nPurpose\\nAdrenalectomy is usually advised for patients with\\ntumors of the adrenal glands. Adrenal gland tumors maybe malignant or benign, but all typically excrete excessiveamounts of one or more hormones. A successful proce-dure will aid in correcting hormone imbalances, and mayalso remove cancerous tumors that can invade other partsof the body. Occasionally, adrenalectomy may be recom-mended when hormones produced by the adrenal glandsaggravate another condition such as breast cancer .\\nPrecautions\\nThe adrenal glands are fed by numerous blood ves-\\nsels, so surgeons need to be alert to extensive bleedingduring surgery. In addition, the adrenal glands lie close toone of the body’s major blood vessels (the vena cava),and to the spleen and the pancreas. The surgeon needs toremove the gland(s) without damaging any of theseimportant and delicate organs.\\nDescription\\nOpen adrenalectomy\\nThe surgeon may operate from any of four direc-\\ntions, depending on the exact problem and the patient’sbody type.\\nIn the anterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nabdominal wall. Usually the incision will be horizontal,just under the rib cage. If the surgeon intends to operateon only one of the adrenal glands, the incision will rununder just the right or the left side of the rib cage. Some-times a vertical incision in the middle of the abdomenprovides a better approach, especially if both adrenalglands are involved.\\nIn the posterior approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\nback, just beneath the rib cage. If both glands are to beremoved, an incision is made on each side of the body.This approach is the most direct route to the adrenalglands, but it does not provide quite as clear a view of thesurrounding structures as the anterior approach.\\nIn the flank approach, the surgeon cuts into the\\npatient’s side. This is particularly useful in massively obesepatients. If both glands need to be removed, the surgeonmust remove one gland, repair the surgical wound, turn thepatient onto the other side, and repeat the entire process.\\nThe last approach involves an incision into the chest\\ncavity, either with or without part of the incision into theabdominal cavity. It is used when the surgeon anticipatesa very large tumor, or if the surgeon needs to examine orremove nearby structures as well.\\nLaparoscopic adrenalectomy\\nThis technique does not require the surgeon to open\\nthe body cavity. Instead, four small incisions (about 1/2in diameter each) are made into a patient’s flank, justunder the rib cage. A laparoscope, which enables the sur-geon to visualize the inside of the abdominal cavity on atelevision monitor, is placed through one of the incisions.The other incisions are for tubes that carry miniaturizedversions of surgical tools. These tools are designed to beoperated by manipulations that the surgeon makes out-side the body.\\nPreparation\\nMost aspects of preparation are the same as in other\\nmajor operations. In addition, hormone imbalances areoften a major challenge. Whenever possible, physicianswill try to correct hormone imbalances through medica-tion in the days or weeks before surgery. Adrenal tumorsmay cause other problems such as hypertension or inad-\\nequate potassium in the blood, and these problems alsoshould be resolved if possible before surgery is per-formed. Therefore, a patient may take specific medicinesfor days or weeks before surgery.\\nMost adrenal tumors can be imaged very well with a\\nCT scan or MRI, and benign tumors tend to look differ-ent on these tests than do cancerous tumors. Surgeonsmay order a CT scan, MRI, or scintigraphy (viewing ofthe location of a tiny amount of radioactive agent) to helplocate exactly where the tumor is.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 63AdrenalectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 63'),\n",

Approximately one in100,000 people is affected by ALD. There are three basicforms of ALD: childhood, adult-onset, and neonatal. Thechildhood form of the disease is the classical form and isthe most severe. Childhood ALD is progressive and usu-ally leads to total disability or death . It affects only boys\\nbecause the genetic defect is sex-linked (carried on the Xchromosome). Onset usually occurs between ages fourand ten and can include many different symptoms, not allof which appear together. The most common symptomsare behavioral problems and poor memory. Other symp-toms frequently seen are loss of vision, seizures, poorlyarticulated speech, difficulty swallowing, deafness, prob-lems with gait and coordination, fatigue , increased skin\\npigmentation, and progressive dementia .\\nThe adult-onset form of the disease, also called\\nadrenomyeloneuropathy, is milder, progresses slowly, isusually associated with a normal life span, and usuallyappears between ages 21-35. Symptoms may includeprogressive stiffness, weakness, or paralysis of the lower\\nlimbs and loss of coordination. Brain function deteriora-tion may also been seen. Women who are carriers of thedisease occasionally experience the same symptoms, aswell as others, including ataxia, hypertonia (excessivemuscle tone), mild peripheral neuropathy , and urinary\\nproblems. The neonatal form affects both male andfemale infants and may produce mental retardation ,\\nfacial abnormalities, seizures, retinal degeneration, poormuscle tone, enlarged liver, and adrenal dysfunction.Neonatal ALD usually progresses rapidly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe genetic defect in ALD causes a decrease in the\\nability to degrade very long chain fatty acids. These buildup in the adrenal glands, brain, plasma, and fibroblasts.The build-up of very long chain fatty acids interfereswith the ability of the adrenal gland to convert choles-terol into steroids and causes demyelination of nerves inthe white matter of the brain. Demyelinated nerve cellsare unable to function properly.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made based on observed symptoms, a\\nbiochemical test, and a family history. The biochemicaltest detects elevated levels of very long chain fatty acidsin samples from amniocentesis , chorionic villi, plasma,\\nred blood cells, or fibroblasts. A family history may indi-cate the likelihood of ALD because the disease is carriedon the X-chromosome by the female lineage of families.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for all forms of ALD consists of treating\\nthe symptoms and supporting the patient with physicaltherapy, psychological counseling, and special educationin some cases. There is no cure for this disease, and thereare no drugs that can reverse demyelination of nerve andbrain cells. Dietary measures consist of reducing theintake of foods high in fat, which are a source of verylong chain fatty acids. A mixture called Lorenzo’s Oilhas been shown to reduce the level of long chain fattyacids if used long term; however, the rate of myelin loss\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 66Adrenoleukodystrophy3GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 66'),\n",

ARDS is not itself a specific disease, but a syn-drome, a group of symptoms and signs that make up oneof the most important forms of lung or respiratory fail-\\nure. It can develop quite suddenly in persons whose\\nlungs have been perfectly normal. Very often ARDS is atrue medical emergency. The basic fault is a breakdownof the barrier, or membrane, that normally keeps fluidfrom leaking out of the small blood vessels of the lunginto the breathing sacs (the alveoli).\\nDescription\\nAnother name for ARDS is shock lung. Its formal\\nname is misleading, because children, as well as adults,may be affected. In the lungs the smallest blood vessels,or capillaries, make contact with the alveoli, tiny air sacsat the tips of the smallest breathing tubes (the bronchi).This is the all-important site where oxygen passes fromair that is inhaled to the blood, which carries it to all partsof the body. Any form of lung injury that damages thispoint of contact, called the alveolo-capillary junction,will allow blood and tissue fluid to leak into the alveoli,eventually filling them so that air cannot enter. The resultis the type of breathing distress called ARDS. ARDS isone of the major causes of excess fluid in the lungs, theother being heart failure .\\nAlong with fluid there is a marked increase in\\ninflamed cells in the lungs. There also is debris left overfrom damaged lung cells, and fibrin, a semi-solid materi-al derived from blood in the tissues. Typically thesematerials join together with large molecules in the blood(proteins), to form hyaline membranes. (These mem-branes are very prominent in premature infants whodevelop respiratory distress syndrome; it is often calledhyaline membrane disease.) If ARDS is very severe orlasts a long time, the lungs do not heal, but rather becomescarred, a process known as fibrosis. The lack of a nor-mal amount of oxygen causes the blood vessels of thelung to become narrower, and in time they, too, maybecome scarred and filled with clotted blood. The lungsas a whole become very “stiff,” and it becomes muchharder for the patient to breathe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA very wide range of diseases or toxic substances,\\nincluding some drugs, can cause ARDS. They include:\\n• Breathing in (aspiration) of the stomach contents when\\nregurgitated, or salt water or fresh water from nearlydrowning.\\n• Inhaling smoke, as in a fire; toxic materials in the air,\\nsuch as ammonia or hydrocarbons; or too much oxy-gen, which itself can injure the lungs.\\n• Infection by a virus or bacterium, or sepsis , a wide-\\nspread infection that gets into the blood.\\n• Massive trauma, with severe injury to any part of the\\nbody.\\n• Shock with persistently low blood pressure may not in\\nitself cause ARDS, but it can be an important factor.\\n• A blood clotting disorder called disseminated intravas-\\ncular coagulation, in which blood clots form in vesselsthroughout the body, including the lungs.\\n• A large amount of fat entering the circulation and trav-\\neling to the lungs, where it lodges in small blood ves-sels, injuring the cells lining the vessel walls.\\n• An overdose of a narcotic drug, a sedative, or, rarely,\\naspirin .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 67Adult respiratory distress syndromeGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 67'),\n",

Convulsions also may cause some cases.\\nUsually ARDS develops within one to two days of the\\noriginal illness or injury. The person begins to take rapidbut shallow breaths. The doctor who listens to the patient’schest with a stethoscope may hear “crackling” or wheez-\\ningsounds. The low blood oxygen content may cause the\\nskin to appear mottled or even blue. As fluid continues tofill the breathing sacs, the patient may have great troublebreathing, take very rapid breaths, and gasp for air.\\nDiagnosis\\nA simple test using a device applied to the ear will\\nshow whether the blood is carrying too little oxygen, andthis can be confirmed by analyzing blood taken from anartery. The chest x ray may be normal in the early stages,\\nbut, in a short time, fluid will be seen where it does notbelong. The two lungs are about equally affected. A heartof normal size indicates that the problem actually is ARDSand not heart failure. Another way a physician can distin-guish between these two possibilities is to place a catheterKEY TERMS\\nAlveoli —The tiny air sacs at the ends of the breath-\\ning tubes of the lung where oxygen normally istaken up by the capillaries to enter the circulation.\\nAspiration —The process in which solid food, liq-\\nuids, or secretions that normally are swallowedare, instead, breathed into the lungs.\\nCapillaries —The smallest arteries which, in the\\nlung, are located next to the alveoli so that theycan pick up oxygen from inhaled air.\\nFace mask —The simplest way of delivering a high\\nlevel of oxygen to patients with ARDS or otherlow-oxygen conditions.\\nSteroids —A class of drugs resembling normal\\nbody substances that often help control inflamma-tion in the body tissues.\\nVentilator —A mechanical device that can take\\nover the work of breathing for a patient whoselungs are injured or are starting to heal.into a vein and advance it into the main artery of the lung.\\nIn this way, the pressure within the pulmonary capillariescan be measured. Pressure within the pulmonary capillar-ies is elevated in heart failure, but normal in ARDS.\\nTreatment\\nThe three main goals in treating patients with ARDS\\nare:\\n• To treat whatever injury or disease has caused ARDS.\\nExamples are: to treat septic infection with the properantibiotics , and to reduce the level of oxygen therapy if\\nARDS has resulted from a toxic level of oxygen.\\n• To control the process in the lungs that allows fluid to\\nleak out of the blood vessels. At present there is no cer-tain way to achieve this. Certain steroid hormones havebeen tried because they can combat inflammation, butthe actual results have been disappointing.\\n• To make sure the patient gets enough oxygen until the\\nlung injury has had time to heal. If oxygen delivered bya face mask is not enough, the patient is placed on aventilator, which takes over breathing, and, through atube placed in the nose or mouth (or an incision in thewindpipe), forces oxygen into the lungs. This treatmentmust be closely supervised, and the pressure adjustedso that too much oxygen is not delivered.\\nPatients with ARDS should be cared for in an inten-\\nsive care unit, where experienced staff and all neededequipment are available. Enough fluid must be provided,by vein if necessary, to prevent dehydration . Also, the\\npatient’s nutritional state must be maintained, again byvein, if oral intake is not sufficient.\\nPrognosis\\nIf the patient’s lung injury does not soon begin to\\nheal, the lack of sufficient oxygen can injure other organs,such as the kidneys. There always is a risk that bacterialpneumonia will develop at some point. Without prompt\\ntreatment, as many as 90% of patients with ARDS can beexpected to die. With modern treatment, however, abouthalf of all patients will survive. Those who do live usuallyrecover completely, with little or no long-term breathingdifficulty. Lung scarring is a risk after a long period on aventilator, but it may improve in the months after thepatient is taken off ventilation. Whether a particularpatient will recover depends to a great extent on whetherthe primary disease that caused ARDS to develop in thefirst place can be effectively treated.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent ARDS is to avoid those dis-\\neases and harmful conditions that damage the lung.

In the Western countries,the length of life is often into the 70s. The upward limit ofthe life span, however, can be as high as 120 years. Duringthe latter half of life, an individual is more prone to haveproblems with the various functions of the body and todevelop any number of chronic or fatal diseases. The car-diovascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductiveand urinary systems are particularly affected. The mostcommon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,cancer , diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and develop-\\nment around the time of their mid 20s. Aging is the normaltransition time after that flurry of activity. Although thereare quite a few age-related changes that tax the body, dis-ability is not necessarily a part of aging.

Typically, the total padding of bodyfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulatesaround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats isimpaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases,including cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.\\n• The amount of water in the body decreases, which there-\\nfore decreases the absorption of water-soluble nutrients.Also, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.\\n• The liver and the kidneys cannot function as efficiently,\\nthus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\n• A decrease in the ease of digestion, with a decrease in\\nstomach acid production.\\n• A loss of muscle strength and coordination, with an\\naccompanying loss of mobility, agility, and flexibility.\\n• A decline in sexual hormones and sexual functioning.\\n• A decrease in the sensations of taste and smell.• Changes in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems,\\nleading to decreased oxygen and nutrients throughoutthe body.\\n• Decreased functioning of the nervous system so that\\nnerve impulses are not transmitted as efficiently, reflex-es are not as sharp, and memory and learning arediminished.\\n• A decrease in bone strength and density.\\n• Hormone levels, which gradually decline.

It may be that several factors worktogether or that one particular factor is at work more thanothers in a given individual.\\n• Programmed senescence, or aging clock, theory. The\\naging of the cells of each individual is programmed intothe genes, and there is a preset number of possible reju-venations in the life of a given cell. When cells die at arate faster than they are replaced, organs do not func-tion properly, and they are soon unable to maintain thefunctions necessary for life.\\n• Genetic theory. Human cells maintain their own seed of\\ndestruction at the level of the chromosomes.\\n• Connective tissue, or cross-linking theory. Changes in\\nthe make-up of the connective tissue alter the stabilityof body structures, causing a loss of elasticity and func-tioning, and leading to symptoms of aging.\\n• Free-radical theory. The most commonly held theory of\\naging, it is based on the fact that ongoing chemicalreactions of the cells produce free radicals. In the pres-ence of oxygen, these free radicals cause the cells of thebody to break down. As time goes on, more cells die orlose the ability to function, and the body soon ceases tofunction as a whole.\\n• Immunological theory. There are changes in the immune\\nsystem as it begins to wear out, and the body is moreprone to infections and tissue damage, which may finallycause death . Also, as the system breaks down, the body\\nis more apt to have autoimmune reactions, in which thebody’s own cells are mistaken for foreign material andare destroyed or damaged by the immune system.\\nDiagnosis\\nMany problems can arise due to age-related changes\\nin the body. Although there is no one test to be given, athorough physical exam and a basic blood screening andblood chemistry panel can point to areas in need of fur-ther attention. When older people become ill, the firstsigns of disease are often nonspecific. Further examsshould be conducted if any of the following occur:\\n• diminished or lack of desire for food\\n• increasing confusion• failure to thrive\\n• urinary incontinence• dizziness• weight loss• falling\\nTreatment\\nFor the most part, doctors prescribe medications to\\ncontrol the symptoms and diseases of aging. In the Unit-ed States, about two-thirds of people 65 and over takemedications for various complaints. More women thanmen use these medications. The most common drugsused by the elderly are painkillers, diuretics or water\\npills, sedatives, cardiac drugs, antibiotics , and mental\\nhealth drugs.\\nEstrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is commonly\\nprescribed to postmenopausal women for symptoms ofaging. It is often used in conjunction with progesterone.ERT functions to help keep bones strong, reduce risk ofheart disease, restore vaginal lubrication, and to improveskin elasticity. Evidence suggests that it may also helpmaintain mental functions.\\nExpected results\\nAging is unavoidable, but major physical impair-\\nment is not. People can lead a healthy, disability-free lifewell through their later years. A well established supportsystem of family, friends, and health care providers,together with focus on good nutrition and lifestyle\\nhabits and good stress management, can prevent disease\\nand lessen the impact of chronic conditions.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNutritional supplements\\nConsumption of a high–quality multivitamin is rec-\\nommended. Common nutritional deficiencies connectedwith aging include B vitamins , vitamins A and C, folic\\nacid, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, chromium, and\\ntrace minerals . Since stomach acids may be decreased, it\\nis suggested that the use of a powdered multivitamin for-mula in gelatin capsules be used, as this form is the easi-est to digest. Such formulas may also contain enzymesfor further help with digestion.\\nAntioxidants can help to neutralize damage by the\\nfree radical actions thought to contribute to problems ofaging.

People with phobias feel dread or panic when they\\nface certain objects, situations, or activities. People withagoraphobia frequently also experience panic attacks, butpanic attacks, or panic disorder , are not a requirement\\nfor a diagnosis of agoraphobia. The defining feature ofagoraphobia is anxiety about being in places from which\\nescape might be embarrasing or difficult, or in whichhelp might be unavailable. The person suffering fromagoraphobia usually avoids the anxiety-provoking situa-tion and may become totally housebound.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAgoraphobia is the most common type of phobia, and\\nit is estimated to affect between 5-12% of Americans withintheir lifetime. Agoraphobia is twice as common in womenas in men and usually strikes between the ages of 15-35.\\nThe symptoms of the panic attacks which may\\naccompany agoraphobia vary from person to person, andmay include trembling, sweating, heart palpitations (a\\nfeeling of the heart pounding against the chest), jitters,fatigue , tingling in the hands and feet, nausea, a rapid\\npulse or breathing rate, and a sense of impending doom.\\nAgoraphobia and other phobias are thought to be the\\nresult of a number of physical and environmental factors.For instance, they have been associated with biochemicalimbalances, especially related to certain neurotransmit-ters (chemical nerve messengers) in the brain. Peoplewho have a panic attack in a given situation (e.g., a shop-ping mall) may begin to associate the panic with that sit-uation and learn to avoid it. According to some theories,irrational anxiety results from unresolved emotional con-flicts. All of these factors may play a role to varyingextents in different cases of agoraphobia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 72AgoraphobiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 72'),\n",

The doctor can diagnosethe underlying panic or anxiety disorder and make surethe symptoms aren’t related to some other underlyingmedical condition.\\nThe doctor makes the diagnosis of agoraphobia\\nbased primarily on the patient’s description of his or hersymptoms. The person with agoraphobia experiencesanxiety in situations where escape is difficult or help isunavailable—or in certain situations, such as being alone.While many people are somewhat apprehensive in thesesituations, the hallmark of agoraphobia is that a person’sactive avoidance of the feared situation impairs his or herability to work, socialize, or otherwise function.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for agoraphobia usually consists of both\\nmedication and psychotherapy. Usually, patients canbenefit from certain antidepressants, such as amitripty-line (Elavil), or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ,\\nsuch as paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), or sertra-line (Zoloft). In addition, patients may manage panicattacks in progress with certain tranquilizers called ben-\\nzodiazepines , such as alprazolam (Xanax) or clon-\\nazepam (Klonipin).\\nThe mainstay of treatment for agoraphobia and other\\nphobias is cognitive behavioral therapy. A specific tech-nique that is often employed is called desensitization.The patient is gradually exposed to the situation that usu-ally triggers fear and avoidance, and, with the help ofbreathing or relaxation techniques, learns to cope withthe situation. This helps break the mental connectionbetween the situation and the fear, anxiety, or panic.Patients may also benefit from psychodynamically ori-ented psychotherapy, discussing underlying emotionalconflicts with a therapist or support group.\\nPrognosis\\nWith proper medication and psychotherapy, 90% of\\npatients will find significant improvement in their symp-toms.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHallowell, Edward M.

No vaccineis currently available to prevent HIV infection. At present,all forms of AIDS therapy are focused on improving thequality and length of life for AIDS patients by slowing orhalting the replication of the virus and treating or prevent-ing infections and cancers that take advantage of a per-son’s weakened immune system.\\nDescription\\nAIDS is considered one of the most devastating public\\nhealth problems in recent history.

Of these patients, 44%are gay or bisexual men, 20% are heterosexual intravenousdrug users, and 17% are women. In addition, approximate-ly 1,000-2,000 children are born each year with HIV infec-tion. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that33 million adults and 1.3 million children worldwide wereliving with HIV/AIDS as of 1999 with 5.4 million beingnewly infected that year. Most of these cases are in thedeveloping countries of Asia and Africa.\\nRisk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:\\n• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, those who are not monoga-mous, those who participate in anal intercourse, andthose who have sex with a partner with symptoms ofadvanced HIV infection and/or other sexually trans-\\nmitted diseases (STDs). In the United States and\\nEurope, most cases of sexually transmitted HIV infec-tion have resulted from homosexual contact, whereas inAfrica, the disease is spread primarily through sexualintercourse among heterosexuals.\\n• Transmission in pregnancy . High-risk mothers include\\nwomen married to bisexual men or men who have anabnormal blood condition called hemophilia and\\nrequire blood transfusions, intravenous drug users, andwomen living in neighborhoods with a high rate of HIVinfection among heterosexuals. The chances of trans-\\nmitting the disease to the child are higher in women inadvanced stages of the disease. Breast feeding increasesthe risk of transmission by 10-20%. The use of zidovu-dine (AZT) during pregnancy, however, can decreasethe risk of transmission to the baby.\\n• Exposure to contaminated blood or blood products.\\nWith the introduction of blood product screening in themid-1980s, the incidence of HIV transmission in bloodtransfusions has dropped to one in every 100,000 trans-fused. With respect to HIV transmission among drugabusers, risk increases with the duration of using injec-tions, the frequency of needle sharing, the number ofpersons who share a needle, and the number of AIDScases in the local population.\\n• Needle sticks among health care professionals. Present\\nstudies indicate that the risk of HIV transmission by a nee-dle stick is about one in 250. This rate can be decreased ifthe injured worker is given AZT, an anti-retroviral medica-tion, in combination with other medication.\\nHIV is not transmitted by handshakes or other casu-\\nal non-sexual contact, coughing or sneezing, or by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes.\\nAIDS in women\\nAIDS in women is a serious public health concern.\\nWomen exposed to HIV infection through heterosexualcontact are the most rapidly growing risk group in theUnited States population. The percentage of AIDS casesdiagnosed in women has risen from 7% in 1985 to 23% in1999.

As of 2000, it was estimated that87% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing age; 41%of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of children bornto HIV-positive women will be infected with the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in chil-\\ndren between one and four years of age. The intervalbetween exposure to HIV and the development of AIDS isshorter in children than in adults. Infants infected with HIVhave a 20-30% chance of developing AIDS within a yearand dying before age three. In the remainder, AIDS pro-gresses more slowly; the average child patient survives toseven years of age. Some survive into early adolescence.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organsystems. HIV attacks the body through three diseaseprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\\nvous system dysfunction.\\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\\nthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or isnot functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiencyresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein calledCD4, which is primarily found on the surface of certainsubtypes of white blood cells called helper T cells or CD4cells. After the virus has attached to the CD4 receptor, thevirus-CD4 complex refolds to uncover another receptorcalled a chemokine receptor that helps to mediate entry ofthe virus into the cell. One chemokine receptor in particu-lar, CCR5, has gotten recent attention after studies showedthat defects in its structure (caused by genetic mutations)cause the progression of AIDS to be prevented or slowed.Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to the develop-ment of drugs that trigger an artificial mutation of theCCR5 gene or target the CCR5 receptor.\\nOnce HIV has entered the cell, it can replicate intra-\\ncellularly and kill the cell in ways that are still not com-pletely understood. In addition to killing some lympho-cytes directly, the AIDS virus disrupts the functioning of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 75AIDS\\nMature HIV-1 viruses (above) and the lymphocyte from which they emerged (below).Two immature viruses can be seen bud-\\nding on the surface of the lymphocyte (right of center).

Because the immune system\\ncells are destroyed, many different types of infectionsand cancers that take advantage of a person’s weakenedimmune system (opportunistic) can develop.\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against itsown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced inresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, proteinor particle called an antigen. In this case, the body pro-duces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are nec-essary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair. Oncebound, the antibodies mark the platelets for removal fromthe body, and they are filtered out by the spleen. SomeAIDS patients develop a disorder, called immune-relatedthrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), in which the number\\nof blood platelets drops to abnormally low levels.\\nAs of 2000, researchers do not know precisely how\\nHIV attacks the nervous system since the virus can causedamage without infecting nerve cells directly. One theoryis that, once infected with HIV , one type of immune sys-tem cell, called a macrophage, begins to release a toxinthat harms the nervous system.\\nThe course of AIDS generally progresses through\\nthree stages, although not all patients will follow thisprogression precisely:\\nAcute retroviral syndrome\\nAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe\\na group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosisand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-70%of all patients and 45-90% of women. Most patients arenot recognized as infected during this phase and may notseek medical attention. The symptoms may includefever ,fatigue , muscle aches, loss of appetite, digestive\\ndisturbances, weight loss, skin rashes ,headache , and\\nchronically swollen lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy).Approximately 25-33% of patients will experience aform of meningitis during this phase in which the mem-\\nbranes that cover the brain and spinal cord becomeinflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome develops betweenone and six weeks after infection and lasts for two tothree weeks. Blood tests during this period will indicatethe presence of virus (viremia) and the appearance of theviral p24 antigen in the blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the diseasebecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more beforesymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,the virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, whereit may cause one or more of the following conditions:PERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY (PGL).\\nPersistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL, is a con-dition in which HIV continues to produce chronic painlessswellings in the lymph nodes during the latency period.The lymph nodes that are most frequently affected by PGLare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.PGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and generalweakness. HIV may also cause a combination of foodmalabsorption, loss of appetite, and increased metabo-lism that contribute to the so-called AIDS wasting orwasting syndrome.\\nOTHER ORGAN SYSTEMS. At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a yeastinfection in the mouth called thrush, open sores or ulcers,or other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and other gas-\\ntrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition and\\nweight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; anddegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.HIV infection of the nervous system leads to general lossof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness orburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.\\nLate-stage disease (AIDS)\\nAIDS is usually marked by a very low number of\\nCD4+ lymphocytes, followed by a rise in the frequencyof opportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitorthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in thepatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of thedisease and the effectiveness of different medications.About 10% of infected individuals never progress to thisovert stage of the disease and are referred to as nonpro-gressors.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm3, he or\\nshe is at risk for a variety of opportunistic infections. Theinfectious organisms may include the following:\\n• Fungi. The most common fungal disease associated\\nwith AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP).\\nPCP is the immediate cause of death in 15-20% ofAIDS patients. It is an important measure of a patient’sprognosis. Other fungal infections include a yeastinfection of the mouth ( candidiasis or thrush) and\\ncryptococcal meningitis.\\n• Protozoa. Toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic\\ninfection in AIDS patients that is caused by a proto-zoan. Other diseases in this category include isoporiasisand cryptosporidiosis.\\n• Mycobacteria.

AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to\\ncytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),varicella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-gressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem, cere-brum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoencephalopathyor PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-defining illnessby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nAIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-\\nPLICATIONS. AIDS dementia complex is usually a late\\ncomplication of the disease. It is unclear whether it iscaused by the direct effects of the virus on the brain or byintermediate causes. AIDS dementia complex is marked\\nby loss of reasoning ability, loss of memory, inability toconcentrate, apathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadi-ness or weakness in walking. Some patients also developseizures. There are no specific treatments for AIDSdementia complex.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in\\nlate-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-cles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-like pains in the joints.\\nORAL SYMPTOMS. In addition to thrush and painful\\nulcers in the mouth, patients may develop a conditioncalled hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This condition isalso regarded by the CDC as an indicator of AIDS.

The polymerase chain reac-tion (PCR) test can be used to detect the presence of viralnucleic acids in the very small number of HIV patientswho have false-negative results on the ELISA and West-ern blot tests. These tests are also used to detect virusesand bacterium other than HIV and AIDS.\\nOTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos-\\ntic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used totrack the course of AIDS in patients that have alreadybeen diagnosed. These include blood counts, viral loadtests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of /H9252\\n2-\\nmicroglobulin ( /H92522M).\\nDoctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose the\\npresence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or other dis-ease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biopsies, samples ofcerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated imaging techniques,such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed\\ntomography scans (CT) are used to diagnose AIDS-related\\ncancers, some opportunistic infections, damage to the centralnervous system, and wasting of the muscles.

Younger infants can be diag-nosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,and p24 antigen testing.\\nIn terms of symptoms, children are less likely than\\nadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, howev-er, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequentillness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,failure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Childrenwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-tions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related braindisorders than are HIV-positive adults.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for AIDS covers four considerations:\\nTREATMENT OF OPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS AND\\nMALIGNANCIES. Most AIDS patients require complex\\nlong-term treatment with medications for infectious dis-eases. This treatment is often complicated by the devel-opment of resistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-related malignancies in the central nervous system areusually treated with radiation therapy . Cancers else-\\nwhere in the body are treated with chemotherapy .PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT FOR OPPORTUNISTIC\\nINFECTIONS. Prophylactic treatment is treatment that is\\ngiven to prevent disease. AIDS patients with a history ofPneumocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200\\ncells/mm\\n3or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush\\nshould be given prophylactic medications. The threedrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-sone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.\\nANTI-RETROVIRAL TREATMENT. In recent years\\nresearchers have developed drugs that suppress HIVreplication, as distinct from treating its effects on thebody. These drugs fall into three classes:\\n• Nucleoside analogues. These drugs work by interfering\\nwith the action of HIV reverse transcriptase inside infect-ed cells, thus ending the virus’ replication process. Thesedrugs include zidovudine (sometimes called azidothymi-dine or AZT), didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), stavu-dine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), and abacavir (ABC).\\n•Protease inhibitors . Protease inhibitors can be effective\\nagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance tonucleoside analogues, and are often used in combinationwith them. These compounds include saquinavir, riton-avir, indinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, and lopinavir.\\n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is\\na new class of antiretroviral agents. Three are available,nevirapine, which was approved first, delavirdine andefavirin.\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in constant\\nchange as new medications are developed and intro-duced. Two principles currently guide doctors in workingout drug regimens for AIDS patients: using combinationsof drugs rather than one medication alone; and basingtreatment decisions on the results of the patient’s viralload tests.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION.\\nBecause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormal-ly low levels of both red and white blood cells, they maybe given medications to stimulate blood cell production.Epoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemicpatients. Patients with low white blood cell counts maybe given filgrastim or sargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-\\nlarly important in that anti-retroviral therapy has beenshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AIDS can be grouped into\\ntwo categories: those intended to help the immune sys-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 80AIDSGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 80'),\n",

Treatments that\\nmay enhance the function of the immune system includeChinese herbal medicine and western herbal medicine,macrobiotic and other special diets ,guided imagery and\\ncreative visualization, homeopathy , and vitamin therapy.\\nPain control therapies include hydrotherapy ,reiki ,\\nacupuncture ,meditation ,chiropractic treatments, and\\ntherapeutic massage. Alternative therapies can also beused to help with side effects of the medications used inthe treatment of AIDS.\\nPrognosis\\nAt the present time, there is no cure for AIDS.\\nTreatment stresses aggressive combination drug\\ntherapy for those patients with access to the expensivemedications and who tolerate them adequately. The useof these multi-drug therapies has significantly reducedthe numbers of deaths, in this country, resulting fromAIDS. The data is still inconclusive, but the potentialexists to possibly prolong life indefinitely using theseand other drug therapies to boost the immune system,keep the virus from replicating, and ward off opportunis-tic infections and malignancies.\\nPrognosis after the latency period depends on the\\npatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systemsaffected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-phomas of the central nervous system die within two tothree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-phomas may survive for eight to ten months.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 2001, there is no vaccine effective against\\nAIDS. Several vaccines are currently being investigated,however, both to prevent initial HIV infection and as atherapeutic treatment to prevent HIV from progressing tofull-blown AIDS.\\nIn the meantime, there are many things that can be\\ndone to prevent the spread of AIDS:\\n• Be monogamous and practice safe sex. Individuals\\nmust be instructed in the proper use of condoms andurged to practice safe sex. Besides avoiding the risk ofHIV infection, condoms are successful in preventingother sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted preg-nancies. Before engaging in a sexual relationship withsomeone, get tested for HIV infection.\\n• Avoid needle sharing among intravenous drug users.\\n• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-\\ntored, those individuals who are planning to undergomajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of timeto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion .• Healthcare professionals must taken all necessary pre-\\ncautions by wearing gloves and masks when handlingbody fluids and preventing needle-stick injuries.\\n• If you suspect that you may have become infected, get\\ntested for HIV infection. If treated aggressively earlyon, the development of AIDS may be postponed indefi-nitely. If HIV infection is confirmed, it is also vital tolet your sexual partners know so that they can be testedand, if necessary, receive medical attention.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEarly HIV Infection Guideline Panel.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='AIDS tests\\nDefinition\\nAIDS tests, short for acquired immunodeficiency\\nsyndrome tests, cover a number of different proceduresused in the diagnosis and treatment of HIV patients. Thesetests are sometimes called AIDS serology tests. Serologyis the branch of immunology that deals with the contentsand characteristics of blood serum. Serum is the clear lightyellow part of blood that remains liquid when blood cellsform a clot. AIDS serology evaluates the presence ofhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in bloodserum and its effects on each patient’s immune system.\\nPurpose\\nAIDS serology serves several different purposes.\\nSome AIDS tests are used to diagnose patients or con-firm a diagnosis; others are used to measure the progres-sion of the disease or the effectiveness of specific treat-ment regimens. Some AIDS tests can also be used toscreen blood donations for safe use in transfusions.\\nIn order to understand the different purposes of the\\nblood tests used with AIDS patients, it is helpful tounderstand how HIV infection affects human blood andthe immune system. HIV is a retrovirus that enters theblood stream of a new host in the following ways:\\n• by sexual contact\\n• by contact with infected body fluids (such as blood and\\nurine)\\n• by transmission during pregnancy ,o r\\n• through transfusion of infected blood products\\nA retrovirus is a virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to replicate with-in new host cells. The virus binds to a protein called CD4,which is found on the surface of certain subtypes of whiteblood cells, including helper T cells, macrophages, andmonocytes. Once HIV enters the cell, it can replicate andkill the cell in ways that are still not completely under-stood. In addition to killing some lymphocytes directly, theAIDS virus disrupts the functioning of the remaining CD4cells. CD4 cells ordinarily produce a substance calledinterleukin-2 (IL-2), which stimulates other cells (T cellsand B cells) in the human immune system to respond toinfections. Without the IL-2, T cells do not reproduce asthey normally would in response to the HIV virus, and Bcells are not stimulated to respond to the infection.\\nPrecautions\\nIn some states such as New York, a signed consent\\nform is needed in order to administer an AIDS test. Aswith all blood tests, healthcare professionals shouldalways wear latex gloves and to avoid being pricked bythe needle used in drawing blood for the tests. Also, itmay be difficult to get blood from a habitual intravenousdrug user due to collapsed veins.\\nDescription\\nDiagnostic tests\\nDiagnostic blood tests for AIDS are usually given to\\npersons in high-risk populations who may have beenexposed to HIV or who have the early symptoms ofAIDS. Most persons infected with HIV will develop adetectable level of antibody within three months of infec-tion. The condition of testing positive for HIV antibodyin the blood is called seroconversion, and persons whohave become HIV-positive are called seroconverters.\\nIt is possible to diagnose HIV infection by isolating\\nthe virus itself from a blood sample or by demonstratingthe presence of HIV antigen in the blood. Viral culture,however, is expensive, not widely available, and slow—ittakes 28 days to complete the viral culture test. Morecommon are blood tests that work by detecting the pres-ence of antibodies to the HIV virus. These tests are inex-pensive, widely available, and accurate in detecting99.9% of AIDS infections when used in combination toscreen patients and confirm diagnoses.\\nENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY (ELISA).\\nThis type of blood test is used to screen blood for trans-fusions as well as diagnose patients. An ELISA test forHIV works by attaching HIV antigens to a plastic well orbeads. A sample of the patient’s blood serum is added,and excess proteins are removed. A second antibody cou-pled to an enzyme is added, followed by addition of asubstance that will cause the enzyme to react by forminga color. An instrument called a spectrophotometer canmeasure the color. The name of the test is derived fromthe use of the enzyme that is coupled or linked to the sec-ond antibody.\\nThe latest generation of ELISA tests are 99.5% sen-\\nsitive to HIV . Occasionally, the ELISA test will be posi-tive for a patient without symptoms of AIDS from a low-risk group. Because this result is likely to be a false-posi-tive, the ELISA must be repeated on the same sample of\\nthe patient’s blood . If the second ELISA is positive, the\\nresult should be confirmed by the Western blot test.\\nWESTERN BLOT (IMMUNOBLOT). The Western blot\\nor immunoblot test is used as a reference procedure toconfirm the diagnosis of AIDS. In Western blot testing,HIV antigen is purified by electrophoresis (large proteinmolecules are suspended in a gel and separated from oneanother by running an electric current through the gel).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 82AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 82'),\n",

The patient’s serum is reacted againstthe filter, followed by treatment with developing chemi-cals that allow HIV antibody to show up as a coloredpatch or blot. A commercially produced Western blot testfor HIV-1 is now available. It consists of a prefabricatedstrip that is incubated with a sample of the patient’s bloodserum and the developing chemicals. About nine differentHIV-1 proteins can be detected in the blots.\\nWhen used in combination with ELISA testing,\\nWestern blot testing is 99.9% specific. It can, however,yield false negatives in patients with very early HIVinfection and in those infected by HIV-2. In somepatients the Western blot yields indeterminate results.\\nIMMUNOFLUORESCENCE ASSAY (IFA). This method\\nis sometimes used to confirm ELISA results instead ofWestern blotting. An IFA test detects the presence ofHIV antibody in a sample of the patient’s serum by mix-ing HIV antigen with a fluorescent chemical, adding theblood sample, and observing the reaction under a micro-scope with ultraviolet light.\\nPOLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR). This test is\\nused to evaluate the very small number of AIDS patientswith false-negative ELISA and Western blot tests. Thesepatients are sometimes called antibody-negative asympto-matic (without symptoms) carriers, because they do nothave any symptoms of AIDS and there is no detectablequantity of antibody in the blood serum. Antibody-nega-tive asymptomatic carriers may be responsible for thevery low ongoing risk of HIV infection transmitted byblood transfusions. It is estimated that the risk is between1 in 10,000 and 1 in 100,000 units of transfused blood.\\nThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can mea-\\nsure the presence of viral nucleic acids in the patient’sblood even when there is no detectable antibody to HIV .This test works by amplifying the presence of HIV nucle-ic acids in a blood sample. Numerous copies of a gene aremade by separating the two strands of DNA containingthe gene segment, marking its location, using DNA poly-merase to make a copy, and then continuously replicatingthe copies. It is questionable whether PCR will replaceWestern blotting as the method of confirming AIDS diag-noses. Although PCR can detect the low number of per-sons (1%) with HIV infections that have not yet generatedan antibody response to the virus, the overwhelmingmajority of infected persons will be detected by ELISAscreening within one to three months of infection. Inaddition, PCR testing is based on present knowledge ofthe genetic sequences in HIV . Since the virus is continual-ly generating new variants, PCR testing could yield afalse negative in patients with these new variants.In 1999, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\n(FDA) approved an HIV home testing kit. The kit containsmultiple components, including material for specimen col-lection, a mailing envelope to send the specimen to a labo-ratory for analysis, and provides pre- and post-test coun-seling. It uses a finger prick process for blood collection.The results are obtained by the purchaser through a tollfree telephone number using a personal identificationnumber (PIN). Post test counseling is provided over thetelephone by a licensed counselor. The only kit approvedby the FDA as of 2001 was the Home Access test system.\\nPrognostic tests\\nBlood tests to evaluate patients already diagnosed\\nwith HIV infection are as important as the diagnostictests. Because AIDS has a long latency period, some per-sons may be infected with the virus for 10 years or longerbefore they develop symptoms of AIDS. These patientsare sometimes called antibody-positive asymptomaticcarriers. Prognostic tests also help drug researchers eval-uate the usefulness of new medications in treating AIDS.\\nBLOOD CELL COUNTS. Doctors can measure the\\nnumber or proportion of certain types of cells in an AIDSpatient’s blood to see whether and how rapidly the dis-ease is progressing, or whether certain treatments arehelping the patient.

A white blood cell count that is brokendown into categories in this way is called a WBC dif-ferential.\\nIt is important for doctors treating AIDS patients to\\nmeasure the lymphocyte count on a regular basis.Experts consulted by the United States Public HealthService recommend the following frequency of serumtesting based on the patient’s CD4+ level:\\n• CD4+ count more than 600 cells/mm\\n3: Every six months.KEY TERMS\\ncan monitor the health of AIDS patients by measur-\\ning the number or proportion of certain types oflymphocytes in the patient’s blood.\\nMacrophage —A large white blood cell, found pri-\\nmarily in the bloodstream and connective tissue,that helps the body fight off infections by ingestingthe disease organism. HIV can infect and killmacrophages.\\nMonocyte —A large white blood cell that is formed\\nin the bone marrow and spleen. About 4% of thewhite blood cells in normal adults are monocytes.\\nOpportunistic infection —An infection that devel-\\nops only when a person’s immune system is weak-ened, as happens to AIDS patients.\\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) —A test performed\\nto evaluate false-negative results to the ELISA andWestern blot tests. In PCR testing, numerous copiesof a gene are made by separating the two strands ofDNA containing the gene segment, marking itslocation, using DNA polymerase to make a copy,and then continuously replicating the copies. Theamplification of gene sequences that are associatedwith HIV allows for detection of the virus by thismethod.\\nRetrovirus —A virus that contains a unique enzyme\\ncalled reverse transcriptase that allows it to repli-cate within new host cells.\\nSeroconversion —The change from HIV- negative to\\nHIV-positive status during blood testing. Personswho are HIV-positive are called seroconverters.Serology —The analysis of the contents and proper-\\nties of blood serum.\\nSerum —The part of human blood that remains liq-\\nuid when blood cells form a clot. Human bloodserum is clear light yellow in color.\\nT cells —Lymphocytes that originate in the thymus\\ngland. T cells regulate the immune system’sresponse to infections, including HIV. CD4 lympho-cytes are a subset of T lymphocytes.\\nViral load test —A new blood test for monitoring the\\nspeed of HIV replication in AIDS patients. The viralload test is based on PCR techniques and supple-ments the CD4+ cell count tests.\\nWestern blot —A technique developed in 1979 that\\nis used to confirm ELISA results. HIV antigen is puri-fied by electrophoresis and attached by blotting to anylon or nitrocellulose filter. The patient’s serum isreacted against the filter, followed by treatment withdeveloping chemicals that allow HIV antibody toshow up as a colored patch or blot. If the patient isHIV-positive, there will be stripes at specific loca-tions for two or more viral proteins. A negativeresult is blank.\\nWBC differential —A white blood cell count in\\nwhich the technician classifies the different whiteblood cells by type as well as calculating the num-ber of each type. A WBC differential is necessary tocalculate the absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count.\\n• CD4+ count between 200-600 cells/mm\\n3: Every three\\nmonths.\\n• CD4+ count less than 200 cells/mm3: Every three months.\\nWhen the CD4+ count falls below 200 cells/mm3,\\nthe doctor will put the patient on a medication regimen toprotect him or her against opportunistic infections.\\nHIV VIRAL LOAD TESTS. Another type of blood test\\nfor monitoring AIDS patients is the viral load test. It sup-plements the CD4+ count, which can tell the doctor theextent of the patient’s loss of immune function, but notthe speed of HIV replication in the body.

Found in the viral\\ncore of HIV , p24 is a protein that can be measured bythe ELISA technique. Doctors can use p24 assays tomeasure the antiviral activity of the patient’s medica-tions. In addition, the p24 assay is sometimes useful indetecting HIV infection before seroconversion. Howev-er, p24 is consistently present in only 25% of personsinfected with HIV .\\nGENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TEST. Genotypic\\ntesting can help determine whether specific gene muta-tions, common in people with HIV , are causing drugresistance and drug failure. The test looks for specificgenetic mutations of within the virus that are known tocause resistance to certain drugs used in HIV treatment.For example the drug 3TC, also known as lamivudine(Epivir), is not effective against strains of HIV that havea mutation at a particular position on the reverse tran-scriptase protein—amino acid 184—known as M184V(M/L50478V , methionine to valine). So if the genotypic resis-\\ntance test shows a mutation at position M184V , it is like-ly that person is resistant to 3TC and not likely torespond to 3TC treatment. Genotypic tests are onlyeffective if the person is already taking antiviral medica-tion and if the viral load is greater than 1,000 copies permilliliter (mL) of blood. The cost of the test, usuallybetween $300 and $500, is usually now covered bymany insurance plans.\\nPHENOTYPIC DRUG RESISTANCE TESTING. Pheno-\\ntypic testing directly measures the sensitivity of apatient’s HIV to particular drugs and drug combinations.To do this, it measures the concentration of a drugrequired to inhibit viral replication in the test tube. Thisis the same method used by researchers to determinewhether a drug might be effective against HIV beforeusing it in human clinical trials. Phenotypic testing is amore direct measurement of resistance than genotypictesting. Also, unlike genotypic testing, phenotypic test-ing does not require a high viral load but it is recom-mended that persons already be taking antiretroviral\\ndrugs . The cost is between $700 and $900 and is now\\ncovered by many insurance plans.AIDS serology in children\\nChildren born to HIV-infected mothers may acquire\\nthe infection through the mother’s placenta or during thebirth process. Public health experts recommend the test-ing and monitoring of all children born to mothers withHIV . Diagnostic testing in children older than 18 monthsis similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening con-firmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diagnosedby direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing, and p24antigen testing. These techniques allow a pediatrician toidentify 50% of infected children at or near birth, and95% of cases in infants three to six months of age.\\nPreparation\\nPreparation and aftercare are important parts of AIDS\\ndiagnostic testing. Doctors are now advised to take thepatient’s emotional, social, economic, and other circum-stances into account and to provide counseling before andafter testing. Patients are generally better able to cope withthe results if the doctor has spent some time with thembefore the blood test explaining the basic facts about HIVinfection and testing. Many doctors now offer this type ofinformational counseling before performing the tests.\\nAftercare\\nIf the test results indicate that the patient is HIV- pos-\\nitive, he or she will need counseling, information, referralfor treatment, and support. Doctors can either counsel thepatient themselves or invite an experienced HIV coun-selor to discuss the results of the blood tests with thepatient. They will also assess the patient’s emotional andpsychological status, including the possibility of violentbehavior and the availability of a support network.\\nRisks\\nThe risks of AIDS testing are primarily related to\\ndisclosure of the patient’s HIV status rather than to anyphysical risks connected with blood testing. Somepatients are better prepared to cope with a positive diag-nosis than others, depending on their age, sex, health,resources, belief system, and similar factors.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results for ELISA, Western blot, IFA, and\\nPCR testing are negative for HIV antibody.\\nNormal results for blood cell counts:\\n• WBC differential: Total lymphocytes 24-44% of the\\nwhite blood cells.\\n• Hematocrit: 40-54% in men; 37-47% in women.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 86AIDS testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 86'),\n",

It is probably the most specific test forliver damage. However, the severity of the liver damageis not necessarily shown by the ALT test, since theamount of dead liver tissue does not correspond to higherALT levels. Also, patients with normal, or declining,ALT levels may experience serious liver damage withoutan increase in ALT.\\nNevertheless, ALT is widely used, and useful,\\nbecause ALT levels are elevated in most patients withliver disease. Although ALT levels do not necessarilyindicate the severity of the damage to the liver, they mayindicate how much of the liver has been damaged. ALTlevels, when compared to the levels of a similar enzyme,aspartate aminotransferase (AST), may provide impor-tant clues to the nature of the liver disease. For example,within a certain range of values, a ratio of 2:1 or greaterfor AST: ALT might indicate that a patient suffers fromalcoholic liver disease. Other diagnostic data may begleaned from ALT tests to indicate abnormal results.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations are necessary for this test.\\nAftercare\\nThis test involves blood being drawn, probably from\\na vein in the patient’s elbow. The patient should keep thewound from the needle puncture covered (with a ban-dage) until the bleeding stops. Patients should report anyunusual symptoms to their physician.\\nNormal results\\nNormal values vary from laboratory to laboratory,\\nand should be available to your physician at the time ofthe test. An informal survey of some laboratories indi-cates many laboratories find values from approximatelyseven to 50 IU/L to be normal.\\nAbnormal results\\nLow levels of ALT (generally below 300 IU/L) may\\nindicate any kind of liver disease. Levels above 1,000IU/L generally indicate extensive liver damage from tox-ins or drugs, viral hepatitis, or a lack of oxygen (usuallyresulting from very low blood pressure or a heart\\nattack ). A briefly elevated ALT above 1,000 IU/L thatresolves in 24-48 hours may indicate a blockage of the\\nbile duct. More moderate levels of ALT (300-1,000IU/L)may support a diagnosis of acute or chronic hepatitis.\\nIt is important to note that persons with normal liv-\\ners may have slightly elevated levels of ALT.

The condition, which is found in all races, maybe accompanied by eye problems and may lead to skincancer later in life.\\nDescription\\nAlbinism is a rare disorder found in fewer than five\\npeople per 100,000 in the United States and Europe.Other parts of the world have a much higher rate; forexample, albinism is found in about 20 out of every100,000 people in southern Nigeria.\\nThere are 10 types of the most common form of the\\ncondition, known as “oculocutaneous albinism,” whichaffects the eyes, hair, and skin. In its most severe form,hair and skin remain pure white throughout life. Peoplewith a less severe form are born with white hair andskin, which turn slightly darker as they age. Everyonewith oculocutaneous albinism experiences abnormalflickering eye movements ( nystagmus ) and sensitivity\\nto bright light. There may be other eye problems aswell, including poor vision and crossed or “lazy” eyes(strabismus ).\\nThe second most common type of the condition is\\nknown as “ocular” albinism, in which only the eyes lackcolor; skin and hair are normal. There are five forms ofocular albinism; some types cause more problems—especially eye problems—than others.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 88AlbinismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 88'),\n",

Sleepiness, stupor, coma ,o r\\neven death from respiratory depression and low bloodpressure occur at progressively higher concentrations.\\nAlthough alcohol is broken down by the liver, the\\ntoxic effects from a high dose of alcohol are most likely adirect result of alcohol itself rather than of its breakdownproducts. The fatal dose varies widely because peoplewho drink heavily develop a tolerance to the effects ofalcohol with repeated use. In addition, alcohol toleranceresults in the need for higher levels of blood alcohol toachieve intoxicating effects, which increases the likeli-hood that habitual drinkers will be exposed to high andpotentially toxic levels of ethanol. This is particularlytrue when binge drinkers fail to eat, because fasting\\ndecreases the rate of alcohol clearance and causes evenhigher blood alcohol levels.\\nWhen a chronic alcoholic suddenly stops drinking,\\nwithdrawal of alcohol leads to a syndrome of increasedexcitability of the central nervous system, called deliri-um tremens or “DTs.” Symptoms begin six to eighthours after abstinence, and are most pronounced 24-72hours after abstinence. They include body shaking(tremulousness), insomnia , agitation, confusion, hear-\\ning voices or seeing images that are not really there(such as crawling bugs), seizures, rapid heart beat, pro-fuse sweating, high blood pressure, and fever . Alcohol-\\nrelated seizures may also occur without withdrawal,such as during active heavy drinking or after more than aweek without alcohol.\\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is caused by defi-\\nciency of the B-vitamin thiamine, and can also be seen inpeople who don’t drink but have some other cause of thi-amine deficiency, such as chronic vomiting that preventsthe absorption of this vitamin. Patients with this condi-tion have the sudden onset of Wernicke encephalopathy;the symptoms include marked confusion, delirium, dis-orientation, inattention, memory loss, and drowsiness.Examination reveals abnormalities of eye movement,including jerking of the eyes ( nystagmus ) and double\\nvision. Problems with balance make walking difficult.People may have trouble coordinating their leg move-ments, but usually not their arms. If thiamine is not givenpromptly, Wernicke encephalopathy may progress to stu-por, coma, and death.\\nIf thiamine is given and death averted, Korsakoff’s\\nsyndrome may develop in some patients, who suffer\\nfrom memory impairment that leaves them unable toremember events for a period of a few years before theonset of illness (retrograde amnesia ) and unable to learn\\nnew information (anterograde amnesia). Most patientshave very limited insight into their memory dysfunctionand have a tendency to make up explanations for eventsthey have forgotten (confabulation).\\nSevere alcoholism can cause cerebellar degenera-\\ntion, a slowly progressive condition affecting portions ofthe brain called the anterior and superior cerebellar ver-mis, causing a wide-based gait, leg incoordination, andan inability to walk heel-to-toe in tightrope fashion. Thegait disturbance usually develops over several weeks, butmay be relatively mild for some time, and then suddenlyworsen after binge drinking or an unrelated illness.\\nFetal alcohol syndrome occurs in infants born to\\nalcoholic mothers when prenatal exposure to ethanolretards fetal growth and development. Affected infantsoften have a distinctive appearance with a thin upper lip,flat nose and mid-face, short stature and small head size.Almost half are mentally retarded, and most others aremildly impaired intellectually or have problems withspeech, learning, and behavior.\\nAlcoholic myopathy, or weakness secondary to\\nbreakdown of muscle tissue, is also known as alcoholicrhabdomyolysis or alcoholic myoglobinuria. Males areaffected by acute (sudden onset) alcoholic myopathyfour times as often as females. Breakdown of muscle tis-sue (myonecrosis), can come on suddenly during bingedrinking or in the first days of alcohol withdrawal.

Symptoms usually worsen over hours to afew days, and then improve over the next week to 10days as the patient is withdrawn from alcohol. Musclesymptoms are usually generalized, but pain and swellingmay selectively involve the calves or other musclegroups. The muscle breakdown of acute alcoholicmyopathy may be worsened by crush injuries, whichmay occur when people drink so much that they com-press a muscle group with their body weight for a longtime without moving, or by withdrawal seizures withgeneralized muscle activity.\\nIn patients who abuse alcohol over many years,\\nchronic alcoholic myopathy may develop. Males andfemales are equally affected. Symptoms include pain-less weakness of the limb muscles closest to the trunkand the girdle muscles, including the thighs, hips,shoulders, and upper arms. This weakness developsgradually, over weeks or months, without symptoms ofacute muscle injury. Muscle atrophy, or decreased bulk,may be striking. The nerves of the extremities may alsobegin to break down, a condition known as alcoholicperipheral neuropathy , which can add to the person’s\\ndifficulty in moving.\\nThe way in which alcohol destroys muscle tissue is\\nstill not well understood. Proposed mechanisms includemuscle membrane changes affecting the transport of cal-cium, potassium, or other minerals ; impaired muscle\\nenergy metabolism; and impaired protein synthesis.Alcohol is metabolized or broken down primarily by theliver, with a series of chemical reactions in which ethanolis converted to acetate. Acetate is metabolized by skeletalmuscle, and alcohol-related changes in liver functionmay affect skeletal muscle metabolism, decreasing theamount of blood sugar available to muscles during pro-longed activity. Because not enough sugar is available tosupply needed energy, muscle protein may be brokendown as an alternate energy source. However, toxiceffects on muscle may be a direct result of alcohol itselfrather than of its breakdown products.\\nAlthough alcoholic peripheral neuropathy may con-\\ntribute to muscle weakness and atrophy by injuring themotor nerves controlling muscle movement, alcoholicneuropathy more commonly affects sensory fibers.Injury to these fibers can cause tingling or burning painin the feet, which may be severe enough to interfere with\\nwalking. As the condition worsens, pain decreases butnumbness increases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of alcohol-related neurologic disease\\ndepends largely on finding characteristic symptoms andsigns in patients who abuse alcohol. Other possiblecauses should be excluded by the appropriate tests,which may include blood chemistry, thyroid function\\ntests , brain MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) or CT\\n(computed tomography scan), and/or cerebrospinalfluid analysis.\\nAcute alcoholic myopathy can be diagnosed by\\nfinding myoglobin in the urine and increased creatinekinase and other blood enzymes released from injuredmuscle. The surgical removal of a small piece of musclefor microscopic analysis (muscle biopsy) shows thescattered breakdown and repair of muscle fibers. Doc-tors must rule out other acquired causes of musclebreakdown, which include the abuse of drugs such asheroin, cocaine , or amphetamines; trauma with crush\\ninjury; the depletion of phosphate or potassium; or anunderlying defect in the metabolism of carbohydrates orlipids. In chronic alcoholic myopathy, serum creatinekinase often is normal, and muscle biopsy shows atro-phy, or loss of muscle fibers. Electromyography\\n(EMG) may show features characteristic of alcoholicmyopathy or neuropathy.\\nTreatment\\nAcute management of alcohol intoxication, delirium\\ntremens, and withdrawal is primarily supportive, to mon-itor and treat any cardiovascular or respiratory failure\\nthat may develop. In delirium tremens, fever and sweat-ing may necessitate treatment of fluid loss and secondarylow blood pressure. Agitation may be treated with ben-\\nzodiazepines such as chlordiazepoxide, beta-adrenergic\\nantagonists such as atenolol, or alpha 2-adrenergic ago-nists such as clonidine. Because Wernicke’s syndrome israpidly reversible with thiamine, and because death mayintervene if thiamine is not given promptly, all patientsadmitted for acute complications of alcohol, as well asall patients with unexplained encephalopathy, should begiven intravenous thiamine.\\nWithdrawal seizures typically resolve without spe-\\ncific anti-epileptic drug treatment, although status epilep-ticus (continual seizures occurring without interruption)should be treated vigorously.

Alco-holism is the popular term for two disorders, alcoholabuse and alcohol dependence. The hallmarks of boththese disorders involve repeated life problems that can bedirectly attributed to the use of alcohol. Both these disor-ders can have serious consequences, affecting an individ-ual’s health and personal life, as well as having an impacton society at large.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching.\\nAlcohol affects every body system, causing a wide rangeof health problems. Some such problems include poornutrition , memory disorders, difficulty with balance and\\nwalking, liver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis),\\nhigh blood pressure, muscle weakness (including theheart), heart rhythm disturbances, anemia, clotting disor-ders, decreased immunity to infections, gastrointestinalinflammation and irritation, acute and chronic problemswith the pancreas, low blood sugar, high blood fat con-tent, interference with reproductive fertility, and weak-ened bones.\\nOn a personal level, alcoholism results in marital\\nand other relationship difficulties, depression, unemploy-ment, child abuse , and general family dysfunction.\\nAlcoholism causes or contributes to a variety of\\nsevere social problems including homelessness, murder,suicide, injury, and violent crime. Alcohol is a contribut-ing factor in at least 50% of all deaths from motor vehi-cle accidents. In fact, about 100,000 deaths occur eachyear due to the effects of alcohol, of which 50% are dueto injuries of some sort. According to a recent specialreport prepared for the U.S. Congress by the NationalInstitute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, the impactof alcohol on society, including violence, traffic acci-dents, lost work productivity, and premature death , costs\\nour nation an estimated $185 billion annually. In addi-tion, it is estimated that approximately one in four chil-dren (19 million children or 29 percent of children up to17 years of age) is exposed at some time to familial alco-hol abuse, alcohol dependence, or both. Furthermore, ithas been estimated that approximately 18 percent ofadults experience an episode of alcohol abuse or depen-dence a some time during their lives.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are probably a number of factors that work\\ntogether to cause a person to become an alcoholic.Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close rel-atives of an alcoholic are four times more likely tobecome alcoholics themselves. Furthermore, this riskholds true even for children who were adopted awayfrom their biological families at birth and raised in anon-alcoholic adoptive family, with no knowledge oftheir biological family’s difficulties with alcohol. Moreresearch is being conducted to determine if genetic fac-tors could account for differences in alcohol metabo-lism that may increase the risk of an individual becom-ing an alcoholic.\\nThe symptoms of alcoholism can be broken down\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcoholuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nAlcohol exerts a depressive effect on the brain. The\\nblood-brain barrier does not prevent alcohol from enter-ing the brain, so the brain alcohol level will quicklybecome equivalent to the blood alcohol level. Alcohol’sdepressive effects result in difficulty walking, poor bal-ance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 95AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 95'),\n",

The affected person may also have impairment ofperiperal vision. At higher alcohol levels, a person’sbreathing and heart rates will be slowed, and vomitingmay occur (with a high risk of the vomit being breathedinto the lungs, resulting in severe problems, including thepossibility of pneumonia ). Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nLong-term use of alcohol affects virtually every\\norgan system of the body:\\n• Nervous system. An estimated 30-40% of all men in\\ntheir teens and twenties have experienced alcoholicblackout, which occurs when drinking a large quantityof alcohol results in the loss of memory of the timesurrounding the episode of drinking. Alcohol is well-known to cause sleep disturbances, so that overallsleep quality is affected. Numbness and tingling may\\noccur in the arms and legs. Two syndromes, which canoccur together or separately, are known as Wernicke’sand Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to the lowthiamine (a form of vitamin B complex) levels foundin alcoholics. Wernicke’s syndrome results in disor-dered eye movements, very poor balance and difficultywalking, while Korsakoff’s syndrome severely\\naffects one’s memory, preventing new learning fromtaking place.\\n• Gastrointestinal system. Alcohol causes loosening of\\nthe muscular ring that prevents the stomach’s contentsfrom re-entering the esophagus. Therefore, the acidfrom the stomach flows backwards into the esopha-gus, burning those tissues, and causing pain and\\nbleeding. Inflammation of the stomach can also resultin bleeding and pain, and decreased desire to eat. Amajor cause of severe, uncontrollable bleeding (hem-orrhage) in an alcoholic is the development ofenlarged (dilated) blood vessels within the esophagus,which are called esophageal varices. These varices areactually developed in response to liver disease, andare extremely prone to bursting and hemorrhaging.Diarrhea is a common symptom, due to alcohol’s\\neffect on the pancreas. In addition, inflammation ofthe pancreas ( pancreatitis ) is a serious and painful\\nproblem in alcoholics. Throughout the intestinal tract,alcohol interferes with the absorption of nutrients,creating a malnourished state. Because alcohol is bro-ken down (metabolized) within the liver, that organ isseverely affected by constant levels of alcohol. Alco-hol interferes with a number of important chemicalprocesses that also occur in the liver. The liver beginsto enlarge and fill with fat ( fatty liver ), fibrous scartissue interferes with the liver’s normal structure and\\nfunction (cirrhosis), and the liver may becomeinflamed (hepatitis).\\n• Blood. Alcohol can cause changes to all the types of\\nblood cells. Red blood cells become abnormallylarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-tions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakenedimmune system. This places alcoholics at increasedrisk for infections, and is thought to account in partfor the increased risk of cancer faced by alcoholics\\n(ten times increased over normal). Platelets and bloodclotting factors are affected, causing an increased riskof bleeding.\\n• Heart. Small amounts of alcohol cause a drop in blood\\npressure, but with increased use, alcohol begins toincrease blood pressure into a dangerous range. Highlevels of fats circulating in the bloodstream increase therisk of heart disease. Heavy drinking results in anincrease in heart size, weakening of the heart muscle,abnormal heart rhythms, a risk of blood clots formingwithin the chambers of the heart, and a greatlyincreased risk of stroke (due to a blood clot from the\\nheart entering the circulatory system, going to thebrain, and blocking a brain blood vessel).\\n• Reproductive system. Heavy drinking has a negative\\neffect on fertility in both men and women, by decreas-ing testicle and ovary size, and interfering with bothsperm and egg production. When pregnancy is\\nachieved in an alcoholic woman, the baby has a greatrisk of being born with fetal alcohol syndrome , which\\ncauses distinctive facial defects, lowered IQ, andbehavioral problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nTwo different types of alcohol-related difficulties\\nhave been identified. The first is called alcohol depen-\\ndence , which refers to a person who literally depends on\\nthe use of alcohol. Three of the following traits must bepresent to diagnose alcohol dependence:\\n• tolerance, meaning that a person becomes accustomed\\nto a particular dose of alcohol, and must increase thedose in order to obtain the desired effect\\n• withdrawal, meaning that a person experiences\\nunpleasant physical and psychological symptoms whenhe or she does not drink alcohol\\n• the tendency to drink more alcohol than one intends\\n(once an alcoholic starts to drink, he or she finds it dif-ficult to stop)\\n• being unable to avoid drinking or stop drinking once\\nstarted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 96AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 96'),\n",

Because of drinking, a person repeatedly:\\n• fails to live up to his or her most important responsibili-\\nties\\n• physically endangers him or herself, or others (for\\nexample, by drinking when driving)\\n• gets into trouble with the law• experiences difficulties in relationships or jobs\\nDiagnosis is sometimes brought about when family\\nmembers call an alcoholic’s difficulties to the attentionof a physician. A clinician may begin to be suspiciouswhen a patient suffers repeated injuries or begins toexperience medical problems related to the use of alco-hol. In fact, some estimates suggest that about 20% of aphysician’s patients will be alcoholics.\\nDiagnosis is aided by administering specific psycho-\\nlogical assessments that try to determine what aspects ofa person’s life may be affected by his or her use of alco-hol. Determining the exact quantity of alcohol that a per-son drinks is of much less importance than determininghow his or her drinking affects relationships, jobs, educa-tional goals, and family life. In fact, because the metabo-lism of alcohol (how the body breaks down and process-es alcohol) is so individual, the quantity of alcohol con-sumed is not part of the criteria list for diagnosing eitheralcohol dependence or alcohol abuse.\\nOne very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consistsof four questions, with the first letters of each key wordspelling out the word CAGE:\\n• Have you ever tried to Cutdown on your drinking?\\n• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day)?\\nOther, longer lists of questions exist to help deter-\\nmine the severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use.Given the recent research pointing to a genetic basisfor alcoholism, it is important to ascertain whetheranyone else in the person’s family has ever sufferedfrom alcoholism.\\nPhysical examination may reveal signs suggestive\\nof alcoholism: evidence of old injuries; a visible networkof enlarged veins just under the skin around the navel(called caput medusae); fluid in the abdomen ( ascites );\\nyellowish-tone to the skin; decreased testicular size inmen; and poor nutritional status. Lab work may reveal anincrease in the size of the red blood cells; abnormalitiesin the white blood cells (cells responsible for fightinginfection) and platelets (particles responsible for clot-ting); and an increase in certain liver enzymes.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of alcoholism has two parts. The first step\\nin the treatment of alcoholism, called detoxification ,\\ninvolves helping the person stop drinking and ridding hisor her body of the harmful (toxic) effects of alcohol.Because the person’s body has become accustomed toalcohol, the person will need to be supported throughwithdrawal. Withdrawal will be different for differentpatients, depending on the severity of the alcoholism, asmeasured by the quantity of alcohol ingested daily and thelength of time the patient has been an alcoholic. With-drawal symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.Mild withdrawal symptoms include nausea, achiness, diar-rhea, difficulty sleeping, sweatiness, anxiety , and trem-\\nbling. This phase is usually over in about three to fivedays. More severe effects of withdrawal can include hallu-\\ncinations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not actually real), seizures, an unbearablecraving for more alcohol, confusion, fever , fast heart rate,\\nhigh blood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of\\nconsciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severesymptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens)are those with other medical problems, including malnu-\\ntrition , liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome.

No medications are necessary,however. Treatment of a patient suffering the more severeeffects of withdrawal may require the use of sedative med-ications to relieve the discomfort of withdrawal and toavoid the potentially life-threatening complications of highblood pressure, fast heart rate, and seizures. Drugs calledbenzodiazapines are helpful in those patients sufferingfrom hallucinations. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluidsmay need to be given through a vein (intravenously), alongwith some necessary sugars and salts. It is crucial that thi-amine be included in the fluids, because thiamine is usuallyquite low in alcoholic patients, and deficiency of thiamineis responsible for the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.\\nAfter cessation of drinking has been accomplished,\\nthe next steps involve helping the patient avoid ever tak-ing another drink. This phase of treatment is referred toas rehabilitation . The best programs incorporate the\\nfamily into the therapy, because the family has undoubt-edly been severely affected by the patient’s drinking.Some therapists believe that family members, in an effortto deal with their loved one’s drinking problem, some-times develop patterns of behavior that accidentally sup-port or “enable” the patient’s drinking. This situation isreferred to as “co-dependence,” and must be addressed inorder to successfully treat a person’s alcoholism.\\nSessions led by peers, where recovering alcoholics\\nmeet regularly and provide support for each other’srecoveries, are considered some of the best methods ofpreventing a return to drinking (relapse). Perhaps themost well-known such group is called AlcoholicsAnonymous, which uses a “12-step” model to help peo-ple avoid drinking. These steps involve recognizing thedestructive power that alcohol has held over the alco-holic’s life, looking to a higher power for help in over-coming the problem, and reflecting on the ways inwhich the use of alcohol has hurt others and, if possi-ble, making amends to those people. According to arecent study reported by the American PsychologicalAssociation (APA), anyone, regardless of his or herreligious beliefs or lack of religious beliefs, can benefitfrom participation in 12-step programs such as Alco-holics Anonymous (AA) or Narcotics Anonymous(NA). The number of visits to 12-step self-help groupsexceeds the number of visits to all mental health profes-sionals combined.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been usedwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug\\nwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes unpleasant reac-tions including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and trembling.Naltrexone, along with a similar compound, Nalmefene,can be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse. Acam-prosate is helpful in preventing relapse. None of thesemedications would be helpful unless the patient was alsowilling to work very hard to change his or her behavior.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for the\\nalcoholic patient, once the medical danger of withdrawalhas passed. Because many alcoholics have very stressfullives (whether because of or leading to the alcoholism issometimes a matter of debate), many of the treatments foralcoholism involve dealing with and relieving stress . These\\ninclude massage, meditation , and hypnotherapy . The\\nmalnutrition of long-term alcohol use is addressed by nutri-tion-oriented practitioners with careful attention to ahealthy diet and the use of nutritional supplements such asvitamins A, B complex, and C, as well as certain fatty\\nacids, amino acids, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. Herbaltreatments include milk thistle( Silybum marianum ), which\\nis thought to protect the liver against damage. Other herbsare thought to be helpful for the patient suffering throughwithdrawal. Some of these include lavender ( Lavandula\\nofficinalis ), skullcap ( Scutellaria lateriflora ), chamomile\\n(Matricaria recutita ), peppermint ( Mentha piperita )\\nyarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and valerian ( Valeriana\\nofficinalis ). Acupuncture is believed to both decrease\\nwithdrawal symptoms and to help improve a patient’schances for continued recovery from alcoholism.\\nPrognosis\\nRecovery from alcoholism is a life-long process. In\\nfact, people who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-aged to refer to themselves ever after as “a recovering alco-holic,” never a recovered alcoholic. This is because mostresearchers in the field believe that since the potential foralcoholism is still part of the individual’s biological andpsychological makeup, one can never fully recover fromalcoholism. The potential for relapse (returning to illness)is always there, and must be acknowledged and respected.Statistics suggest that, among middle-class alcoholics instable financial and family situations who have undergonetreatment, 60% or more can be successful at an attempt tostop drinking for at least a year, and many for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention must begin at a relatively young age\\nsince the first instance of intoxication (drunkenness) usu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 98AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 98'),\n",

Like all enzymes, it is needed totrigger specific chemical reactions. Aldolase helps mus-cle turn sugar into energy. Testing for aldolase is done todiagnose and monitor skeletal muscle diseases.\\nPurpose\\nSkeletal muscle diseases increase the aldolase level\\nfound in a person’s blood. Skeletal muscles are thosemuscles attached to bones and whose contractions makethose bones move. When the muscles are diseased ordamaged, such as in muscular dystrophy , the cells dete-\\nriorate and break open. The contents of the cells, includ-ing aldolase, spill into the bloodstream. Measuring theamount of aldolase in the blood indicates the degree ofmuscle damage.\\nAs muscles continue to deteriorate, aldolase levels\\ndecrease and eventually fall below normal. Less musclemeans fewer cells and less aldolase.\\nMuscle weakness may be caused by neurologic as\\nwell as muscular problems. The measurement of aldolaselevels can help pinpoint the cause. Aldolase levels will benormal where muscle weakness is caused by neurologi-cal disease, such as poliomyelitis or multiple sclerosis ,\\nbut aldolase levels will be elevated in cases of musculardisease, such as muscular dystrophy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 99AlcoholismGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 99'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='There are two types of aldosteronism: primary and sec-\\nondary. Primary aldosteronism is most commonly causedby an adrenal tumor, as in Conn’s syndrome. Idiopathic(of unknown cause) hyperaldosteronism is another type\\nof primary aldosteronism. Secondary aldosteronism ismore common and may occur with congestive heart fail-\\nure,cirrhosis with fluid in the abdominal cavity\\n(ascites ), certain kidney diseases, excess potassium,\\nsodium-depleted diet, and toxemia of pregnancy .\\nTo differentiate primary aldosteronism from sec-\\nondary aldosteronism, a plasma renin test should be per-formed at the same time as the aldosterone assay. Renin,an enzyme produced in the kidneys, is high in secondaryaldosteronism and low in primary aldosteronism.\\nDescription\\nAldosterone testing can be performed on a blood\\nsample or on a 24-hour urine specimen. Several factors,including diet, posture (upright or lying down), and timeof day that the sample is obtained can cause aldosteronelevels to fluctuate. Blood samples are affected by short-term fluctuations. A urine specimen collected over anentire 24-hour period lessens the effects of those inter-fering factors and provides a more reliable aldosteronemeasurement.\\nPreparation\\nFasting is not required for either the blood sample\\nor urine collection, but the patient should maintain a nor-mal sodium diet (approximately 0.1 oz [3 g] /day) for atleast two weeks before either test. The doctor shoulddecide if drugs that alter sodium, potassium, and fluidbalance (e.g., diuretics , antihypertensives, steroids, oral\\ncontraceptives ) should be withheld. The test will be\\nmore accurate if these are suspended at least two weeksbefore the test. Renin inhibitors (e.g., propranolol)should not be taken one week before the test, unless per-mitted by the physician. The patient should avoid licoricefor at least two weeks before the test, because of itsaldosterone-like effect. Strenuous exercise and stress\\ncan increase aldosterone levels as well. Because the testis usually performed by a method called radioimmunoas-say, recently administered radioactive medications willaffect test results.\\nSince posture and body position affect aldosterone,\\nhospitalized patients should remain in an upright position(at least sitting) for two hours before blood is drawn.Occasionally blood will be drawn again before thepatient gets out of bed. Nonhospitalized patients shouldarrive at the laboratory in time to maintain an uprightposition for at least two hours.Risks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nNormal results are laboratory-specific and also vary\\nwith sodium intake, with time of day, source of specimen(e.g., peripheral vein, adrenal vein, 24-hour urine), age,sex, and posture.\\nReference ranges for blood include:\\n• supine (lying down): 3-10 ng/dL• upright (sitting for at least two hours): Female: 5-\\n30ng/dL; Male: 6-22 ng/dL\\nReference ranges for urine: 2-80 mg/24 hr.\\nAbnormal results\\nIncreased levels of aldosterone are found in Conn’s\\ndisease (aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor), and incases of Bartter’s syndrome (a condition in which thekidneys overexcrete potassium, sodium and chloride,resulting in low blood levels of potassium and high bloodlevels of aldosterone and renin).

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='Alemtuzumab\\nDefinition\\nAlemtuzumab is sold as Campath in the United\\nStates. Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal anti-body that selectively binds to CD52, a protein found onthe surface of normal and malignant B and T cells, that isused to reduce the numbers of circulating malignant cellsof patients who have B-cell chronic lymphocyticleukemia (B-CLL).\\nPurpose\\nAlemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat\\nB-CLL, one of the most prevalent forms of adult chronicleukemia. It specifically binds CD52, a protein found onthe surface of essentially all B and T cells of the immunesystem. By binding the CD52 protein on the malignant Bcells, the antibody targets it for removal from the circula-tion. Scientists believe that alemtuzumab triggers anti-body-mediated lysis of the B cells, a method that theimmune system uses to eliminate foreign cells.\\nAlemtuzumab has been approved by the FDA for\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. For a patient’s disease tobe classified as refractory, both alkylating agents and flu-darabine treatment must have been tried and failed. Thus,this drug gives patients who have tried all approved treat-ments for B-CLL another option. As most patients withB-CLL are in stage III or IV by the time both alkylatingagents and fludarabine have been tried, the experiencewith alemtuzumab treatment are primarily with thosestages of the disease. In clinical trials, about 30% ofpatients had a partial response to the drug, with 2% ofthese being complete responses.\\nThis antibody has been tested with limited success\\nin the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) andfor the preparation of patients with various immune cellmalignancies for bone marrow transplantation. There isalso a clinical trial ongoing to test the ability of this anti-body to prevent rejection in kidney transplantation.\\nDescription\\nAlemtuzumab is produced in the laboratory using\\ngenetically engineered single clones of B-cells. Like allantibodies, it is a Y-shaped molecule can bind one partic-ular substance, the antigen for that monoclonal antibody.For alemtuzumab, the antigen is CD52, a protein foundon the surface of normal and malignant B and T cells aswell as other cells of the immune and male reproductivesystems. Alemtuzumab is a humanized antibody, mean-ing that the regions that bind CD52, located on the tips ofthe Y branches, are derived from rat antibodies, but therest of the antibody is human sequence. The presence ofthe human sequences helps to reduce the immuneresponse by the patient against the antibody itself, aproblem seen when complete mouse antibodies are usedfor cancer therapies. The human sequences also help toensure that the various cell-destroying mechanisms ofthe human immune system are properly triggered withbinding of the antibody.\\nAlemtuzumab was approved in May of 2001 for the\\ntreatment of refractory B-CLL. It is approved for usealone but clinical trials have tested the ability of the anti-body to be used in combination with the purine analogspentostatin, fludarabine, and cladribine, and rituximab, amonoclonal antibody specific for the CD20 antigen,another protein found on the surface of B cells.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThis antibody should be administered in a gradually\\nescalating pattern at the start of treatment and any timeadministration is interrupted for seven or more days. Therecommended beginning dosage for B-CLL patients is adaily dose of 3 mg of Campath administered as a two-hour IV infusion. Once this amount is tolerated, the doseis increased to 10 mg per day. After tolerating this dose,it can be increased to 30 mg, administered three days aweek. Acetominophen and diphenhydramine hydro-choride are given thirty to sixty minutes before the infu-sion to help reduce side effects.\\nAdditionally, patients generally receive anti-infec-\\ntive medication before treatment to help minimize theserious opportunistic infections that can result from thistreatment. Specifically, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole(to prevent bacterial infections) and famciclovir (to pre-vent viral infections) were used during the clinical trial todecrease infections, although they were not eliminated.\\nPrecautions\\nBlood studies should be done on a weekly basis\\nwhile patients are receiving the alemtuzumab treat-ment. Vaccination during the treatment session is notrecommended, given the T cell depletion that occursduring treatment. Furthermore, given that antibodieslike alumtuzumab can pass through the placenta to thedeveloping fetus and in breast milk, use during preg-nancy and breastfeeding is not recommended unlessclearly needed.\\nSide effects\\nA severe side effect of alemtuzumab treatment is the\\npossible depletion of one or more types of blood cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 102AlemtuzumabGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 102'),\n",

He became an actor and Shake-spearean reciter, and early in his career he began to sufferfrom strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical atten-tion for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with arecommended prescription and extensive periods of rest,his problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began about\\nan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that itwas something he did in the process of reciting thatcaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medicaldoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When thedoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander wasdoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to tryand find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself inthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,walking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve hiscoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One ofhis most startling discoveries was that in order to changethe way he used his body he had to change the way hewas thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a way thathe did not produce unnecessary tension when he attempt-ed speech or movement. After making this discovery atthe end of the nineteenth century, Alexander became apioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints andto improve the expression and spontaneity of theirperformances. Soon a great number of people soughthelp from his teaching for a variety of physical andmental disorders.\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-\\non-one in private lessons. Introductory workshops orworkshops for special applications of the technique(e.g.,workshops for musicians) are also common. Pri-vate lessons range from a half-hour to an hour in length,and are taught in a series. The number of lessons variesaccording to the severity of the student’s difficultieswith coordination or to the extent of the student’s inter-est in pursuing the improvements made possible by con-\\ntinued study. The cost of lessons ranges from $40-80 perhour. Insurance coverage is not widely available, butdiscounts are available for participants in some comple-mentary care insurance plans. Pre-tax Flexible SpendingAccounts for health care cover Alexander techniquelessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortableclothing) and use their hands to help students identifyand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arisesfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discussionsof personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise in thecourse of a lesson.\\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a move-ment (the lessons are a series of movements), mostpeople pull back their heads, raise their shoulderstoward their ears, over-arch their lower backs, tightentheir legs, and otherwise produce excessive tension intheir bodies. Alexander referred to this as misuse ofthe body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be\\nestablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, thehead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simplybecause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out ofbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series ofstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It isskillful use of these reflexes, along with reflex activity inthe feet and legs, the arms and hands, the breathingmechanism, and other parts of the body, that lessons inthe technique aim to develop.\\nAlexander found that optimal functioning of the\\nbody was very hard to maintain, even for the short periodof time it took to complete a single movement. People,especially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-ated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles iscommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-visions or video monitors, too much sitting or drivingand too little walking, or by tension associated with pasttraumas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after awhiplash injury or favoring a broken or sprained leg\\nlong after it has healed are examples of habitual tensioncaused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander tech-\\nnique does is to increase a student’s sensory awarenessof this excessive habitual tension, particularly that inthe neck and spine. Next the student is taught to inhibitthe tension. If the student prepares to sit down, forexample, he will tense his muscles in his habitual way.If he is asked to put aside the intention to sit andinstead to free his neck and allow less constriction in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 104Alexander techniqueGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 104'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='his muscles, he can begin to change his tense habitual\\nresponse to sitting.\\nBy leaving the head resting on the spine in its natur-\\nal free balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, notheld in a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release,the knees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen,a student greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-dents learn to direct themselves this way in activity andbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.\\nPrecautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.\\nTeachers use their hands simply to gently guide studentsin movement. Therefore, both contraindications andpotential physiological side effects are kept to a mini-mum. No forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony struc-ture is attempted, so damage to tissues, even in the caseof errors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the\\ncourse of Alexander lessons, they become more acutelyaware of chronic tension patterns. As students learn torelease excessive tension in their muscles and to sustainthis release in daily activity, they may experience tight-ness or soreness in the connective tissue. This is causedby the connective tissue adapting to the lengthened andreleased muscles and the expanded range of movementin the joints.\\nOccasionally students may get light-headed during a\\nlesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-latory or respiratory functioning.\\nForceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures\\noften indicate suppression of emotion. As musclesrelease during or after an Alexander lesson, students mayexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changesin mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface,bringing to consciousness past injury or trauma. This cancause extreme anxiety , and referrals may be made by the\\nteacher for counseling.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAlexander became well known among the intellectu-\\nal, artistic, and medical communities in London, Eng-land, during the first half of the twentieth century.Among Alexander’s supporters were John Dewey,Aldous Huxley, Bernard Shaw, and renowned scientistsRaymond Dart, G.E.

Like all enzymes, it is needed, in smallamounts, to trigger specific chemical reactions. When itis present in large amounts, it may signify bone or liverdisease or a tumor.\\nPurpose\\nMedical testing of alkaline phosphatase is concerned\\nwith the enzyme that is found in liver, bone, placenta,and intestine. In a healthy liver, fluid containing alkalinephosphate and other substances is continually drainedaway through the bile duct. In a diseased liver, this bileduct is often blocked, keeping fluid within the liver.Alkaline phosphatase accumulates and eventuallyescapes into the bloodstream.\\nThe alkaline phosphatase of the liver is produced by\\nthe cells lining the small bile ducts (ductoles) in the liver.Its origin differs from that of other enzymes calledaminotransferases. If the liver disease is primarily of anobstructive nature (cholestatic), i.e. involving the biliarydrainage system, the alkaline phosphatase will be thefirst and foremost enzyme elevation. If, on the otherhand, the disease is primarily of the liver cells (hepato-cytes), the aminotransferases will rise prominently.Thus,these enzymes are very useful in distinguishing the typeof liver disease—cholestatic or hepatocellular.\\nGrowing bones need alkaline phosphatase. Any con-\\ndition of bone growth will cause alkaline phosphataselevels to rise. The condition may be normal, such as achildhood growth spurt or the healing of a broken bone;or the condition may be a disease, such as bone cancer ,\\nPaget’s disease, or rickets.\\nDuring pregnancy , alkaline phosphatase is made by\\nthe placenta and leaks into the mother’s bloodstream.This is normal.

The end product ofthis reaction is measured; and from that measurement,the amount of alkaline phosphatase in the person’s serumis determined.\\nEach tissue—liver, bone, placenta, and intestine—\\nproduces a slightly different alkaline phosphatase. Thesevariations are called isoenzymes. In the laboratory, alka-line phosphatase is measured as the total amount or theamount of each of the the four isoenzymes. The isoen-zymes react differently to heat, certain chemicals, andother processes in the laboratory. Methods to measurethem separately are based on these differences.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary. Results are usually available the next day.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 5-10 ml blood needed for this test, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet on the person’s upperarm, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, and insertsa needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws the bloodthrough the needle into an attached tube. Collection ofthe sample takes only a few minutes.\\nA person being tested for alkaline phosphatase\\nshouldn’t have anything to eat or drink, except water, foreight to ten hours before the test.

ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction\\nthat occurs in asthma patients who are allergic to this\\nspecific fungus.\\nDescription\\nABPA is an allergic reaction to a species of\\nAspergillus called Aspergillus fumigatus . It is sometimes\\ngrouped together with other lung disorders characterizedby eosinophilia—an abnormal increase of a certain typeof white blood cell in the blood—under the heading ofeosinophilic pneumonia . These disorders are also called\\nhypersensitivity lung diseases.\\nABPA appears to be increasing in frequency in the\\nUnited States, although the reasons for the increase are notclear. The disorder is most likely to occur in adult asthmat-ics aged 20-40. It affects males and females equally.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nABPA develops when the patient breathes air con-\\ntaining Aspergillus spores. These spores are found\\nworldwide, especially around riverbanks, marshes, bogs,forests, and wherever there is wet or decaying vegetation.They are also found on wet paint, construction materials,and in air conditioning systems. ABPA is a nosocomialinfection, which means that a patient can get it in a hos-pital. When Aspergillus spores reach the bronchi, which\\nare the branches of the windpipe that lead into the lungs,the bronchi react by contracting spasmodically. So thepatient has difficulty breathing and usually wheezes orcoughs. Many patients with ABPA also run a low-gradefever and lose their appetites.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ABPA sometimes cough up large\\namounts of blood, a condition that is called hemoptysis .\\nThey may also develop a serious long-term form ofbronchiectasis , the formation of fibrous tissue in the\\nlungs. Bronchiectasis is a chronic bronchial disorder\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 107Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 107'),\n",

ABPA sometimes occurs as a com-plication of cystic fibrosis .\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ABPA is based on a combination of\\nthe patient’s history and the results of blood tests, sputumtests, skin tests, and diagnostic imaging. The doctor willbe concerned to distinguish between ABPA and a wors-ening of the patient’s asthma, cystic fibrosis, or otherlung disorders. There are seven major criteria for a diag-nosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis:\\n• a history of asthma.• an accumulation of fluid in the lung that is visible on a\\nchest x ray .\\n• bronchiectasis (abnormal stretching, enlarging, or\\ndestruction of the walls of the bronchial tubes).\\n• skin reaction to Aspergillus antigen.\\n• eosinophilia in the patient’s blood and sputum.•Aspergillus precipitins in the patient’s blood. Precip-\\nitins are antibodies that react with the antigen to form asolid that separates from the rest of the solution in thetest tube.\\n• a high level of IgE in the patient’s blood. IgE refers to a\\nclass of antibodies in blood plasma that activate allergicreactions to foreign particles.\\nOther criteria that may be used to support the diag-\\nnosis include the presence of Aspergillus in samples of\\nthe patient’s sputum, the coughing up of plugs of brownmucus, or a late skin reaction to the Aspergillus antigen.\\nLaboratory tests\\nThe laboratory tests that are done to obtain this\\ninformation include a complete blood count (CBC), a\\nsputum culture , a blood serum test of IgE levels, and\\na skin test for the Aspergillus antigen. In the skin test, a\\nsmall amount of antigen is injected into the upper layerof skin on the patient’s forearm about four inchesbelow the elbow. If the patient has a high level of IgEantibodies in the tissue, he or she will develop what iscalled a “wheal and flare” reaction in about 15-20 min-utes. A “wheal and flare” reaction is characterized bythe eruption of a reddened, itching spot on the skin.\\nSome patients with ABPA will develop the so-calledlate reaction to the skin test, in which a red, sore,swollen area develops about six to eight hours after theinitial reaction.\\nAspergillus can sometimes be seen under a micro-\\nscope slide made from the patient’s sputum, but the diag-nosis is considered definite only when the fungus is cul-\\ntured in the laboratory. Aspergillus is easy to culture, and\\ncan be identified when it is stained with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Calcofluor, or potassium hydroxide (KOH)preparations.\\nDiagnostic imaging\\nChest x rays and CT scans are used to check for the\\npresence of fluid accumulation in the lungs and signs ofbronchiectasis.\\nTreatment\\nABPA is usually treated with prednisone (Meti-\\ncorten) or other corticosteroids taken by mouth, and\\nwith bronchodilators .\\nAntifungal drugs are notused to treat ABPA because\\nit is caused by an allergic reaction to Aspergillus rather\\nthan by direct infection of tissue.\\nFollow-up care\\nPatients with ABPA should be given periodic\\ncheckups with chest x rays and a spirometer test. Aspirometer is an instrument that evaluates the patient’slung capacity.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with ABPA respond well to corticos-\\nteroid treatment. Others have a chronic course with grad-ual improvement over time. The best indicator of a goodprognosis is a long-term fall in the patient’s IgE level.Patients with lung complications from ABPA may devel-op severe airway obstruction.\\nPrevention\\nABPA is difficult to prevent because Aspergillus is a\\ncommon fungus; it can be found in the saliva and sputumof most healthy individuals. Patients with ABPA can pro-tect themselves somewhat by avoiding haystacks, com-post piles, bogs, marshes, and other locations with wet orrotting vegetation; by avoiding construction sites ornewly painted surfaces; and by having their air condi-tioners cleaned regularly. Some patients may be helpedby air filtration systems for their bedrooms or offices.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Aspergillosis.” In Professional Guide to Diseases. 5th ed.\\nSpringhouse, PA: Springhouse Corporation, 1995.\\nBeavis, Kathleen G. “Systemic Mycoses.” In Current Diagno-\\nsis.V ol. 9.

The skin is\\nthe most obvious site of reaction, but the joints, gastroin-testinal tract, and kidneys are also often affected.\\nAP affects approximately 35,000 people in the Unit-\\ned States each year. Most cases are children between theages of two and seven. Boys are affected more often thangirls, and most cases occur from late fall to winter.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAP is caused by a reaction involving antibodies, spe-\\ncial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies aredesigned to bind with foreign proteins, called antigens.In some situations, antigen-antibody complexes canbecome too large to remain suspended in the blood-stream. When this occurs, they precipitate out andbecome lodged in the capillaries. This can cause the cap-illary to burst, allowing a local hemorrhage.\\nThe source of the antigen causing AP is unknown.\\nAntigens may be introduced by bacterial or viral infec-tion. More than 75% of patients report having had aninfection of the throat, upper respiratory tract, or gas-trointestinal system several weeks before the onset of AP.Other complex molecules can act as antigens as well,including drugs such as antibiotics or vaccines. Other-\\nwise harmless substances that stimulate an immune reac-tion are known as allergens. Drug allergens that maycause AP include penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin,and quinine. Vaccines possibly linked to AP includethose for typhoid, measles ,cholera , and yellow fever .\\nSymptoms\\nThe onset of AP may be preceded by a headache ,\\nfever , and loss of appetite. Most patients first develop an\\nitchy skin rash. The rash is red, either flat or raised, andmay be small and freckle-like. The rash may also be larg-er, resembling a bruise. Rashes become purple and then\\nrust colored over the course of a day, and fade after sev-eral weeks. Rashes are most common on the buttocks,abdomen, and lower extremities. Rashes higher on thebody may also occur, especially in younger children.\\nJoint pain and swelling is common, especially in\\nthe knees and ankles. Abdominal pain occurs in almostall patients, along with blood in the body waste (feces).About half of all patients show blood in the urine, lowurine volume, or other signs of kidney involvement.Kidney failure may occur due to widespread obstructionof the capillaries in the filtering structures calledglomeruli. Kidney failure develops in about 5% of allpatients, and in 15% of those with elevated blood or pro-tein in the urine.Less common symptoms include prolonged head-\\nache, fever, and pain and swelling of the scrotum. Involve-ment of other organ systems may lead to heart attack\\n(myocardial infarction), inflammation of the pancreas(pancreatitis ), intestinal obstruction, or bowel perforation.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AP is based on the symptoms and their\\ndevelopment, a careful medical history, and blood andurine tests. X rays or computed tomography scans (CT)\\nmay be performed to assess complications in the bowelor other internal organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost cases of AP resolve completely without treat-\\nment. Nonetheless, a hospital stay is required because ofthe possibility of serious complications. Non-aspirin painrelievers may be given for joint pain. Corticosteroids (like\\nprednisone) are sometimes used, although not all special-ists agree on their utility. Kidney involvement requiresmonitoring and correction of blood fluids and electrolytes.\\nPatients with severe kidney complications may\\nrequire a kidney biopsy so that tissue can be analyzed.\\nEven after all other symptoms subside, elevated levels ofblood or protein in the urine may persist for months andrequire regular monitoring. Hypertension or kidney fail-\\nure may develop months or even years after the acutephase of the disease. Kidney failure requires dialysis ortransplantation.\\nPlasmapheresis , which removes antibodies from\\nthe blood, has been tried for AP with mixed results.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people who develop AP become better on their\\nown after several weeks. About half of all patients haveat least one recurrence. Cases that do not have kidneycomplications usually have the best prognosis.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nAndreoli, S.

It affects between 10-20% of all people inthe United States, and is responsible for 2.5% of all doc-tor visits. Antihistamines and other drugs used to treat\\nallergic rhinitis make up a significant fraction of bothprescription and over-the-counter drug sales each year.\\nThere are two types of allergic rhinitis: seasonal and\\nperennial. Seasonal AR occurs in the spring, summer,and early fall, when airborne plant pollens are at theirhighest levels. In fact, the term hay fever is really a mis-nomer, since allergy to grass pollen is only one cause ofsymptoms for most people. Perennial AR occurs all yearand is usually caused by home or workplace airbornepollutants. A person can be affected by one or both types.Symptoms of seasonal AR are worst after being out-doors, while symptoms of perennial AR are worst afterspending time indoors.\\nBoth types of allergies can develop at any age,\\nalthough onset in childhood through early adulthood ismost common. Although allergy to a particular substanceis not inherited, increased allergic sensitivity may “run inthe family.” While allergies can improve on their ownover time, they can also become worse over time.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nAllergic rhinitis is a type of immune reaction. Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms, or particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins, called antibodies, that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on the for-eign particle. This reaction between antibody and antigensets off a series of reactions designed to protect the bodyfrom infection. Sometimes, this same series of reactionsis triggered by harmless, everyday substances. This is thecondition known as allergy, and the offending substanceis called an allergen.\\nLike all allergic reactions, AR involves a special\\nset of cells in the immune system known as mast cells.Mast cells, found in the lining of the nasal passagesand eyelids, display a special type of antibody, calledimmunoglobulin type E (IgE), on their surface. Inside,mast cells store reactive chemicals in small packets,called granules. When the antibodies encounter aller-gens, they trigger release of the granules, which spillout their chemicals onto neighboring cells, includingblood vessels and nerve cells. One of these chemicals,histamine, binds to the surfaces of these other cells,through special proteins called histamine receptors.Interaction of histamine with receptors on blood ves-sels causes neighboring cells to become leaky, leadingto the fluid collection, swelling, and increased rednesscharacteristic of a runny nose and red, irritated eyes.Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing the\\nitchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common in aller-gic rhinitis.\\nThe number of possible airborne allergens is enor-\\nmous. Seasonal AR is most commonly caused by grassand tree pollens, since their pollen is produced in largeamounts and is dispersed by the wind. Showy flowers,like roses or lilacs, that attract insects produce a stickypollen which is less likely to become airborne. Differentplants release their pollen at different times of the year,so seasonal AR sufferers may be most affected in spring,summer, or fall, depending on which plants provoke aresponse. The amount of pollen in the air is reflected inthe pollen count, often broadcast on the daily news dur-ing allergy season. Pollen counts tend to be lower after agood rain that washes the pollen out of the air and higheron warm, dry, windy days.\\nVirtually any type of tree or grass may cause AR. A\\nfew types of weeds that tend to cause the most trouble forpeople include the following:\\n• ragweed• sagebrush\\n• lamb’s-quarters\\n• plantain• pigweed• dock/sorrel\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 111Allergic rhinitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:41 PM  Page 111'),\n",

House dust contains some orall of the following:\\n• house mite body parts. All houses contain large num-\\nbers of microscopic insects called house mites. Theseharmless insects feed on fibers, fur, and skin shed bythe house’s larger occupants. Their tiny body parts easi-ly become airborne.\\n• animal dander. Animals constantly shed fur, skin flakes,\\nand dried saliva. Carried in the air, or transferred frompet to owner by direct contact, dander can cause allergyin many sensitive people.\\n• mold spores. Molds live in damp spots throughout the\\nhouse, including basements, bathrooms, air ducts, airconditioners, refrigerator drains, damp windowsills,mattresses, and stuffed furniture. Mildew and othermolds release airborne spores which circulate through-\\nout the house.\\nOther potential causes of perennial allergic rhinitis\\ninclude the following:\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• perfume\\n• cosmetics• cleansers• copier chemicals• industrial chemicals\\n• construction material gases\\nSymptoms\\nInflammation of the nose, or rhinitis, is the major\\nsymptom of AR. Inflammation causes itching , sneezing,\\nrunny nose, redness, and tenderness. Sinus swelling canconstrict the eustachian tube that connects the inner earto the throat, causing a congested feeling and “ear pop-ping.” The drip of mucus from the sinuses down the backof the throat, combined with increased sensitivity, canalso lead to throat irritation and redness. AR usually alsocauses redness, itching, and watery eyes. Fatigue and\\nheadache are also common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing seasonal AR is usually easy and can\\noften be done without a medical specialist. When symp-toms appear in spring or summer and disappear with theonset of cold weather, seasonal AR is almost certainlythe culprit. Other causes of rhinitis, including infection,can usually be ruled out by a physical examination and\\na nasal smear, in which a sample of mucus is taken on aswab for examination.\\nAllergy tests , including skin testing and provoca-\\ntion testing, can help identify the precise culprit, butmay not be done unless a single source is suspected andsubsequent avoidance is possible. Skin testing involvesplacing a small amount of liquid containing a specificallergen on the skin and then either poking, scratching,or injecting it into the skin surface to observe whetherredness and swelling occurs. Provocation testinginvolves challenging an individual with either a smallamount of an inhalable or ingestable allergen to see if aresponse is elicited.\\nPerennial AR can also usually be diagnosed by care-\\nful questioning about the timing of exposure and theonset of symptoms. Specific allergens can be identifiedthrough allergy skin testing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 112Allergic rhinitis\\nThis illustration depicts excessive mucus production in the\\nnose after inhalation of airborne pollen.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content='Treatment\\nAvoidance of the allergens is the best treatment, but\\nthis is often not possible. When it is not possible to avoidone or more allergens, there are two major forms of med-ical treatment, drugs and immunotherapy.\\nDrugs\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect ofhistamine release by mast cells. They may be used aftersymptoms appear, though they may be even more effec-tive when used preventively, before symptoms appear. Awide variety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder antihistamines often produce drowsiness as a\\nmajor side effect. Such antihistamines include the fol-lowing:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)\\n• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)\\n• clemastine (Tavist and generics).\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nare available by prescription and include the following:\\n• astemizole (Hismanal)\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\n• fexofenadine (Allegra)• azelastin HCl (Astelin).\\nHismanal has the potential to cause serious heart\\narrhythmias when taken with the antibiotic ery-\\nthromycin, the antifungal drugs ketoconazole and itra-conazole, or the antimalarial drug quinine. Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal liningand oral systemic preparations are available. Decongestantsare stimulants and may cause increased heart rate and bloodpressure, headaches, and agitation. Use of topical deconges-tants for longer than several days can cause loss of effective-ness and rebound congestion, in which nasal passagesbecome more severely swollen than before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticos-\\nteroids reduce mucous membrane inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worseas the season progresses because the immune system\\nbecomes sensitized to particular antigens and can pro-duce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticosteroidsare especially effective at reducing this seasonal sensiti-zation because they work more slowly and last longerthan most other medication types. As a result, they arebest started before allergy season begins. Side effects areusually mild, but may include headaches, nosebleeds,and unpleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents\\nthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventingrelease of histamine and the other chemicals contained inthem. It acts as a preventive treatment if it is begun sever-al weeks before the onset of the allergy season. It can beused for perennial AR as well.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in thebody, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to cause allergicreactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by allergy testingto determine the precise allergens responsible. Injectionsinvolve very small but gradually increasing amounts ofallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodicboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years toachieve and are not seen at all in about one in fivepatients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitoredclosely following each shot because of the small risk ofanaphylaxis , a condition that can result in difficulty\\nbreathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for AR often focus on modu-\\nlation of the body’s immune response, and frequentlycenter around diet and lifestyle adjustments. Chineseherbal medicine can help rebalance a person’s system, ascan both acute and constitutional homeopathic treatment.Vitamin C in substantial amounts can help stabilize themucous membrane response. For symptom relief, west-ern herbal remedies including eyebright ( Euphrasia\\nofficinalis ) and nettle ( Urtica dioica ) may be helpful.\\nBee pollen may also be effective in alleviating or elimi-nating AR symptoms.\\nPrognosis\\nMost people with AR can achieve adequate relief\\nwith a combination of preventive strategies and treat-ment. While allergies may improve over time, they mayalso get worse or expand to include new allergens.

It is estimated that 60 million Americans, ormore than one in every five people, suffer from someform of allergy, with similar proportions throughoutmuch of the rest of the world. Allergy is the single largestreason for school absence and is a major source of lostproductivity in the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign microorganismsor particles by producing specific proteins called anti-bodies. These antibodies are capable of binding to iden-tifying molecules, or antigens, on the foreign particle.This reaction between antibody and antigen sets off aseries of chemical reactions designed to protect thebody from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substancessuch as pollen, dust, and animal danders. When thisoccurs, an allergy develops against the offending sub-stance (an allergen.)\\nMast cells, one of the major players in allergic reac-\\ntions, capture and display a particular type of antibody,called immunoglobulin type E (IgE) that binds to aller-gens. Inside mast cells are small chemical-filled packetscalled granules. Granules contain a variety of potentchemicals, including histamine.\\nImmunologists separate allergic reactions into two\\nmain types: immediate hypersensitivity reactions, whichare predominantly mast cell-mediated and occur withinminutes of contact with allergen; and delayed hypersen-sitivity reactions, mediated by T cells (a type of whiteblood cells) and occurring hours to days after exposure.\\nInhaled or ingested allergens usually cause immedi-\\nate hypersensitivity reactions. Allergens bind to IgE anti-bodies on the surface of mast cells, which spill the con-tents of their granules out onto neighboring cells, includ-ing blood vessels and nerve cells. Histamine binds to thesurfaces of these other cells through special proteinscalled histamine receptors. Interaction of histamine withreceptors on blood vessels causes increased leakiness,leading to the fluid collection, swelling and increasedredness. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, mak-\\ning tissue more sensitive and irritable. Symptoms lastfrom one to several hours following contact.\\nIn the upper airways and eyes, immediate hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions cause the runny nose and itchy, blood-shot eyes typical of allergic rhinitis . In the gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation ofthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping anddiarrhea typical of food allergy. Allergens that enter thecirculation may cause hives , angioedema, anaphylaxis ,\\nor atopic dermatitis .\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,setting in motion a more prolonged immune response.This type of allergic response may develop over severaldays following contact with the allergen, and symptomsmay persist for a week or more.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAllergens enter the body through four main routes:\\nthe airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and thecirculatory system.\\n• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose,\\nand itchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhini-\\ntis). Airborne allergens can also affect the lining of the\\nlungs, causing asthma , or the conjunctiva of the eyes,\\ncausing conjunctivitis (pink eye). Exposure to cock-\\nroach allergans have been associated with the devel-opment of asthma. Airborne allergans from householdpets are another common source of environmentalexposure.\\n• Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the\\nlips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbedinto the bloodstream, they may cause hives (urticaria)or more severe reactions involving recurrent, non-inflammatory swelling of the skin, mucous membranes,organs, and brain (angioedema). Some food allergensmay cause anaphylaxis,a potentially life-threateningcondition marked by tissue swelling, airwayconstric-tion, and drop in blood pressure. Allergies to foods suchcow’s milk, eggs, nuts, fish, and legumes (peanuts andsoybeans) are common. Allergies to fruits and vegeta-bles may also occur.\\n• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause redden-\\ning, itching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis .\\nSkin reactions can also occur from allergens intro-duced through the airways or gastrointestinal tract.This type of reaction is known as atopic dermatitis .\\nDermatitis may arise from an allergic response (suchas from poison ivy), or exposure to an irritant causingnonimmune damage to skin cells (such as soap, cold,and chemical agents).\\n• Injection of allergens, from insect bites and stings or\\ndrug administration, can introduce allergens directlyinto the circulation, where they may cause system-wideresponses (including anaphylaxis), as well as the localones of swelling and irritation at the injection site.\\nPeople with allergies are not equally sensitive to\\nall allergens.

For example, childhood ragweedallergy may progress to year-round dust and pollenallergy. On the other hand, a person may lose allergicsensitivity. Infant or childhood atopic dermatitis disap-pears in almost all people. More commonly, whatseems to be loss of sensitivity is instead a reducedexposure to allergens or an increased tolerance for thesame level of symptoms.\\nWhile allergy to specific allergens is not inherited,\\nthe likelihood of developing some type of allergy seemsto be, at least for many people. If neither parent hasallergies, the chances of a child developing allergy isapproximately 10-20%; if one parent has allergies, it is30-50%; and if both have allergies, it is 40-75%.Onesource of this genetic predisposition is in the ability toproduce higher levels of IgE in response to allergens.Those who produce more IgE will develop a strongerallergic sensitivity.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne\\nallergens are the following:\\n• plant pollens\\n• animal fur and dander\\n• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n• house dust• mold spores• cigarette smoke• solvents• cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish• eggs• wheat• milk• food additives and preservatives\\nThe following types of drugs commonly cause aller-\\ngic reactions:\\n• penicillin or other antibiotics\\n• flu vaccines\\n• tetanus toxoid vaccine• gamma globulin\\nCommon causes of contact dermatitis include the\\nfollowing:• poison ivy, oak, and sumac\\n• nickel or nickel alloys• latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n• bees, wasps, and hornets• mosquitoes• fleas• scabies\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic\\nreaction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy,runny nose, often with a scratchy or irritated throat dueto post-nasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membranecovering the eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness,irritation, and increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma caus-es wheezing , coughing, and shortness of breath . Symp-\\ntoms of food allergies depend on the tissues most sensi-tive to the allergen and whether the allergen spread sys-temically by the circulatory system. Gastrointestinalsymptoms may include swelling and tingling in the lips,tongue, palate or throat; nausea; cramping; diarrhea; andgas. Contact dermatitis is marked by reddened, itchy,weepy skin blisters, and an eczema that is slow to heal. Itsometimes has a characteritic man-made pattern, such asa glove allergy with clear demarkation on the hands,wrist, and arms where the gloves are worn, or on the ear-lobes by wearing earrings.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common followingingestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactionsinclude the raised, reddened, and itchy patches calledhives that characteristically blanch with pressure andresolve within twenty-four hours. A deeper and moreextensive skin reaction, involving more extensive fluidcollection and pain, is called angioedema. This usuallyoccurs on the extremities, fingers, toes, and parts of thehead,neck,and face. Anaphylaxis is marked by airwayconstriction, blood pressure drop, widespread tissueswelling, heart rhythm abnormalities, and in some cases,loss of consciousness. Other syptoms may include, dizzi-\\nness, weakness, seizures, coughing,flushing, or cramp-\\ning. The symptoms may begin within five minutes afterexposure to the allergan up to one hour or more later.Mast cells in the tissues and basophils in the bloodrelease mediators that give rise to the clinical symptomsof this IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction.

Allergy is suspected ifthe symptoms presented are characteristic of an allergicreaction and this occurs repeatedly upon exposure tothe suspected allergan. Allergy tests can be used to\\nidentify potential allergens, but these must be supportedby eveidence of allergic responses in the patient’s clini-cal history.\\nSkin tests\\nSkin tests are performed by administering a tiny\\ndose of the suspected allergen by pricking, scratching,puncturing or injecting the skin. The allergen is appliedto the skin as an auqeous extract, usually on the back,forearms, or top of the thighs. Once in the skin, the aller-gen may produce a classic immune wheal and flareresponse (a skin lesion with a raise, white, compressiblearea surrounded by a red flare). The tests usually beginwith prick tests or patch tests that expose the skin to\\nsmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. Apositive reaction will occur on the skin even if the aller-gen is at levels normally encountered in food or in theairways. Reactions are usually evaluated approximatelyfifteen minutes after exposure. Intradermal skin testsinvolved injection of the allergan into the dermis of theskin. These tests are more sensitive and are used forallergies associated with risk of death , such as allergies\\nto antibiotics.\\nAllergen-Specific IgE Measurement\\nTests that measure allergen-specific IgE antibodies\\ngenerally follow a basic method. The allergen is boundto a solid support, either in the form of a cellulosesponge, microtiter plate, or paper disk. The patient’sserum is prepared from a blood sample and is incubatedwith the solid phase. If allergen specific IgE antibodiesare present, they will bind to the solid phase and beretained there when the rest of the serum is washedaway. Next, an labeled antibody against the IgE is addedand will bind to any IgE on the solid phase. The excessis washed away and the levels of IgE are determined.The commonly used RAST test (radio allergo sorbent\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 117Allergies\\nAllergic rhinitis is commonly triggered by\\nexposure to household dust, animal fur,or pollen.

Someresearch indicates that there is a higher level of totalserum IgE in allergic as compared to non-allergic peo-ple. However, this may not always be the case as there isconsiderable overlap between the two groups.This test isuseful for the diagnosis of allergic fungal sinusitis and\\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis . Other conditions that\\nare not allergic in nature may give rise to higher IgE lev-els such as smoking ,AIDS , infection with parasites,\\nand IgE myeloma.\\nProvocation tests\\nThese tests involve the administration of allergen to\\nellicit an immune response. Provocation tests, most com-monly done with airborne allergens, present the allergendirectly through the route normally involved. Delayedallergic contact dermatitis diagnosis involves similarmethods by application of a skin patch with allergen toinduce an allergic skin reaction. Food allergen provoca-tion tests require abstinence from the suspect allergen fortwo weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a measuredamount of the test substance administered as an opaquecapsule along with a placebo control. Provocation testsare not used if anaphylaxis is is a concern due to thepatient’s medical history.\\nFuture diagnostic methods\\nAs of 2000, attempts have been made for direct\\nmeasurement of immune mediators such as histamine,eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and mast celltryptase. Another, somewhat controversial,test is elec-trodermal testing or electro-acupuncture allergy testing.This test has been used in Europe and is under investiga-tion in the United States, though not approved by theFood and Drug Administration. An electric potential isapplied to the skin, the allergen presented, and the elec-trical resistance observed for changes. This method hasnot been verified.\\nTreatment\\nAvoiding allergens is the first line of defense to\\nreduce the possibility of an allergic attack. It is helpful toavoid environmental irritants such as tobacco smoke,perfumes, household cleaning agents, paints, glues, airfresheners, and potpourri. Nitrogen dioxide from poorly\\nvented gas stoves, woodburing stoves, and artificial fire-places has also been linked to poor asthma control. Dustmite control is particularly important in the bedroomareas by use of allergen-impermeable covers on mattressand pillows, frequent washing of bedding in hotwater,and removal of items that collect dust such asstuffed toys. Mold growth may be reduced by reducingindoor humidity, repair of house foundations to reduceindoor leaks and seepage, and installation of exhaust sys-tems to ventilate areas where steam is generated such asthe bathroom or kitchen. Allergic individuals shouldavoid pet allergens such as saliva, body excretions, pelts,urine, or feces. For those who insist on keeping a pet,restriction of the animal’s activity to certain areas of thehome may be beneficial.\\nComplete environmental control is often difficult to\\naccomplish, hence therapuetic interventions maybecome necessary. A large number of prescription andover-the-counter drugs are available for treatment ofimmediate hypersensitivity reactions. Most of thesework by decreasing the ability of histamine to provokesymptoms. Other drugs counteract the effects of hista-mine by stimulating other systems or reducing immuneresponses in general.\\nAntihistamines\\nAntihistamines block the histamine receptors on\\nnasal tissue, decreasing the effect of histamine releasedby mast cells. They may be used after symptoms appear,though they may be even more effective when used pre-ventively, before symptoms appear. Antihistamines arehelp reduce sneezing, itching, and rhinorrhea. A widevariety of antihistamines are available.\\nOlder, first generation antihistamines often produce\\ndrowsiness as a major side effect, as well as dry mouth ,\\ntachycardia, blurred vision, constipation , and lower the\\nthreshold for seizures. These medicatios also have simi-lar effects to a alcohol and care should be taken whenoperating motor vehicles, as individuals may not beaware that they are impared. Such antihistamines includethe following:\\n• diphenhydramine (Benadryl and generics)• chlorpheniramine (Chlor-trimeton and generics)• brompheniramine (Dimetane and generics)• clemastine (Tavist and generics)\\nNewer antihistamines that do not cause drowsiness\\nor pass the blood-brain barrier are available by prescrip-tion and include the following:\\n• loratidine (Claritin)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 118AllergiesGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 118'),\n",

Taking morethan the recommended dose of Hismanal can also causearrhythimas. Seldane (terfenadine), the original non-drowsy antihistamine, was voluntarily withdrawn fromthe market by its manufacturers in early 1998 because ofthis potential and because of the availability of an equal-ly effective, safer alternative drug, fexofenadine.\\nDecongestants\\nDecongestants constrict blood vessels to the\\nmucosa to counteract the effects of histamine. Thisdecreases the amount of blood in the nasopahryngealand sinus mucosa and reduces swelling. Nasal spraysare available that can be applied directly to the nasal lin-ing and oral systemicpreparations are available. Decon-gestants are stimulants and may cause increased heartrate and blood pressure, headaches,insomnia,agitation,and difficulty emptying the bladder. Use of topicaldecongestants for longer than several days can causeloss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in whichnasal passages become more severely swollen than\\nbefore treatment.\\nTopical corticosteroids\\nTopical corticosteroids reduce mucous membrane\\ninflammationas by decreasing the amount of fluidmoved from the vascular spaces into the tissues. Thesemedications reduce the recruitment of inflammatorycells as well as the synthesis of cytokines. They areavailable by prescription. Allergies tend to becomeworse as the season progresses because the immune sys-tem becomes sensitized to particular antigens and canproduce a faster, stronger response. Topical corticos-teroids are especially effective at reducing this seasonalsensitization because they work more slowly and lastlonger than most other medication types. As a result,they are best started before allergy season begins.

Calamine lotion appliedto affected skin can reduce irritation somewhat, as cancold water compresses. Side effects of topical agentsmay include over-drying of the skin.In the case of acutecontact dermatitis, short-term oral corticosteroid therapymay be appropriate. Moderately strong coricosteroidscan also be applied as a wrap for twenty-four hours.Health care workers are especially at risk for hand erup-tions due to glove use.\\nTreatment of anaphylaxis\\nThe emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated\\nwith injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.People who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food orinsect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containingadrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Other medicationsmay be given to aid the action of the epi-pen. Promptinjection can prevent a more serious reaction fromdeveloping. Paticular care should be taken to assess theaffected individual’s airway status, and he or she shouldbe placed in a recumbent pose and vital signs deter-mined. If a reaction resulted from insect sting or aninjection, a tourniquet may need to be placed proximalto the area where the agent penetrated the skin. Thisshould then be released at intervals of ten minutes at atime, for one to two minutes duration. If the individualdoes not respond to such interventions, then emergency\\ntreatment is appropriate.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAny alternative treatment for allergies begins with\\nfinding the cause and then helping the patient to avoidor eliminate the allergen, although this is not alwayspossible. As with any alternative therapy, a physicianshould be consulted before initiating a new form oftreatment. Education on the use of alternative agents iscritical, as they are still “drugs” even though they arederived from natural sources.Various categories ofalternative remedies may be helpful in allergy treat-ment, including:\\n• antihistamines: vitamin C and the bioflavonoid hes-\\nperidin act as natural anithistamines.\\n• decongestants: vitamin C, the homeopathic remedies\\nFerrum phosphoricum and Kali muriaticum (used alter-\\nnately), and the dietary supplement N-acetylcysteineare believed to have decongestant effects.\\n• mast cell stabilizers: the bioflavonoids quercetin and\\nhesperidin may help stabilize mast cells.\\n• immunotherapy: the herbs echinacea (Echinacea spp.)\\nand astragalus or milk-vetch root ( Astragalus mem-\\nbranaceus ) may possibly help to strengthen the\\nimmune system.\\n• bronchodilators: the herbal remedies ephedra ( Ephedra\\nsinica , also known as ma huang in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine ), khellin ( Ammi visnaga ) and cramp bark\\n(Viburnum opulus ) are believed to help open the airways.\\nTreatment of contact dermatitis\\nA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-\\nly or taken internally, may possibly assist in the treat-ment of contact dermatitis.

For food allergies, there is no effectivetreatment except avoidance. By determining the allergensthat are causing reactions, most people can learn to avoidallergic reactions from food, drugs, and contact allergenssuch as poison ivy or latex. Airborne allergens are moredifficult to avoid, although keeping dust and animal dan-der from collecting in the house may limit exposure.Cromolyn sodium can prevent mast cell degranulation,thereby limiting the allergic response.\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or\\nallergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types inthe body, thereby reducing the ability of IgE to causeallergic reactions. Immunotherapy is preceded by aller-gy testing to determine the precise allergens responsi-ble.

Nor-\\nmally, the immune system responds to foreign microor-ganisms and particles, like pollen or dust, by producingspecific proteins called antibodies that are capable ofbinding to identifying molecules, or antigens, on theforeign organisms. This reaction between antibody andantigen sets off a series of reactions designed to protectthe body from infection. Sometimes, this same series ofreactions is triggered by harmless, everyday substances.This is the condition known as allergy, and the offend-ing substance is called an allergen. Common inhaledallergens include pollen, dust, and insect parts from tinyhouse mites. Common food allergens include nuts, fish,and milk.\\nAllergic reactions involve a special set of cells in\\nthe immune system known as mast cells. Mast cellsserve as guards in the tissues where the body meets theoutside world: the skin, the mucous membranes of theeyes and other areas, and the linings of the respiratoryand digestive systems. Mast cells display a special typeof antibody, called immunoglobulin type E (IgE), ontheir surface. Inside, mast cells store reactive chemicalsin small packets, called granules. When the antibodiesencounter allergens, they trigger the release of granules,which spill out their chemicals onto neighboring cells,including blood vessels and nerve cells. One of thesechemicals, histamine, binds to the surfaces of theseother cells, through special proteins called histaminereceptors. Interaction of histamine with receptors onblood vessels causes neighboring cells to become leaky,leading to the fluid collection, swelling, and increasedredness characteristic of a runny nose and red, irritatedeyes. Histamine also stimulates pain receptors, causing\\nthe itchy, scratchy nose, eyes, and throat common inallergic rhinitis .\\nThe particular allergens to which a person is sensi-\\ntive can be determined through allergy testing. Allergytests may be performed on the skin or using blood serumin a test tube. During skin tests, potential allergens areplaced on the skin and the reaction is observed. In radio-allergosorbent allergy testing (RAST), a patient’s bloodserum is combined with allergen in a test tube to deter-mine if serum antibodies react with the allergen. Provo-cation testing involves direct exposure to a likely aller-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 122Allergy testsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 122'),\n",

Positive reac-\\ntions from any of these tests may be used to narrow thecandidates for the actual allergen causing the allergy.\\nIdentification of the allergenic substance may allow\\nthe patient to avoid the substance and reduce allergicreactions. In addition, allergy testing may be done inthose with asthma that is difficult to manage, eczema, or\\nskin rashes to determine if an allergy is causing the con-\\ndition or making it worse. Allergy tests may also be donebefore allergen desensitization to ensure the safety ofmore extensive exposure.\\nSkin testing is the most common type of allergy test.\\nThere are two forms: percutaneous and intradermal. Inpercutaneous or prick testing, allergen solutions areplaced on the skin, and the skin is then pricked with aneedle, allowing the allergen to enter the skin andbecome exposed to mast cells. Scratch testing, in whichthe skin is scratched instead of punctured, is used lessoften. Intradermal testing involves directly injectingallergen solutions into the skin. In both tests, a reddened,swollen spot develops at the injection site for each sub-stance to which the person is sensitive. Skin reactivity isseen for allergens regardless of whether they usuallyaffect the skin. In other words, airborne and food aller-gens cause skin reactions equally well.\\nThe range of allergens used for testing is chosen to\\nreflect possible sources in the environment and mayinclude the following:\\n• pollen from a variety of trees, common grasses, and\\nweeds\\n• mold and fungus spores• house dust• house mites• animal skin cells (dander) and saliva• food extracts• antibiotics• insect venoms\\nRadio-allergosorbent testing (RAST) is a laboratory\\ntest performed when a person may be too sensitive to riskskin testing or when medications or skin conditions pre-vent it.\\nProvocation testing is done to positively identify\\nsuspected allergens after preliminary skin testing. A puri-fied preparation of the allergen is inhaled or ingested inincreasing concentrations to determine if it will provokea response. Food testing is much more tedious thaninhalation testing, since full passage through the diges-tive system may take a day or more.Precautions\\nWhile allergy tests are quite safe for most people,\\nthe possibility of a condition known as anaphylaxis does\\nexist. Anaphylaxis is a potentially dangerous conditionthat can result in difficulty breathing and a sharp drop inblood pressure. People with a known history of anaphy-laxis should inform the testing clinician. Skin testsshould never include a substance known to cause ana-phylaxis in the person being tested.\\nProvocation tests may cause an allergic reaction.\\nTherefore, treatment medications should be available fol-lowing the tests, to be administered, if needed.\\nDescription\\nIn prick testing, a drop of each allergen to be tested\\nis placed on the skin, usually on the forearm or the back.A typical battery of tests may involve two dozen allergendrops, including a drop of saline solution that should notprovoke a reaction (negative control) and a drop of hista-mine that should provoke a reaction (positive control). Asmall needle is inserted through the drop, and used toprick the skin below. A new needle is used for each prick.The sites are examined over the next twenty minutes forevidence of swelling and redness, indicating a positivereaction. In some instances, a tracing of the set of reac-tions may be made by placing paper over the tested area.Similarly, in intradermal testing, separate injections aremade for each allergen tested. Observations are madeover the next twenty minutes.\\nIn RAST testing, a blood sample is taken for use in\\nthe laboratory, where the antibody- containing serum isseparated from the blood cells. The serum is thenexposed to allergens bound to a solid medium.

Location of allergen-antibody combinations isdone by adding antibody-reactive antibodies, so calledanti-antibodies, that are chemically linked with aradioactive dye. By locating radioactive spots on thesolid medium, the reactive allergens are discovered.\\nProvocation testing may be performed to identify air-\\nborne or food allergens. Inhalation testing is performedonly after a patient’s lung capacity and response to themedium used to dilute the allergen has been determined.Once this has been determined, the patient inhales increas-ingly concentrated samples of a particular allergen, fol-lowed each time by measurement of the exhalation capaci-ty. Only one allergen is tested per day. Testing for foodallergies is usually done by removing the suspect food\\nfrom the diet for two weeks, followed by eating a singleportion of the suspect food and follow-up monitoring.\\nPreparation\\nSkin testing is preceded by a brief examination of\\nthe skin. The patient should refrain from using anti-aller-gy drugs for at least 48 hours before testing. Prior toinhalation testing, patients with asthma who can tolerateit may be asked to stop any asthma medications. Testingfor food allergies requires the person to avoid all suspectfood for at least two weeks before testing.\\nAftercare\\nSkin testing does not usually require any aftercare.

Some causes are considered natural, while oth-\\ners signal serious health problems. Some conditions areconfined to the scalp. Others reflect disease throughoutthe body. Being plainly visible, the skin and its compo-nents can provide early signs of disease elsewhere in thebody.\\nOftentimes, conditions affecting the skin of the scalp\\nwill result in hair loss. The first clue to the specific causeis the pattern of hair loss, whether it be complete bald-ness (alopecia totalis), patchy bald spots, thinning, orhair loss confined to certain areas. Also a factor is thecondition of the hair and the scalp beneath it. Sometimesonly the hair is affected; sometimes the skin is visiblydiseased as well.Causes and symptoms\\n• Male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) is consid-\\nered normal in adult males. It is easily recognized bythe distribution of hair loss over the top and front of thehead and by the healthy condition of the scalp.\\n• Alopecia areata is a hair loss condition of unknown\\ncause that can be patchy or extend to complete baldness.\\n• Fungal infections of the scalp usually cause patchy hair\\nloss. The fungus, similar to the ones that cause athlete’s\\nfootand ringworm , often glows under ultraviolet light.\\n• Trichotillomania is the name of a mental disorder that\\ncauses a person to pull out his/her own hair.\\n• Complete hair loss is a common result of cancer\\nchemotherapy, due to the toxicity of the drugs used.Placing a tourniquet around the skull just above the earsduring the intravenous infusion of the drugs mayreduce or eliminate hair loss by preventing the drugsfrom reaching the scalp.\\n• Systemic diseases often affect hair growth either selec-\\ntively or by altering the skin of the scalp. One exampleis thyroid disorders. Hyperthyroidism (too much thy-\\nroid hormone) causes hair to become thin and fine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 125Alopecia\\nTop of balding male’s head.

For more obscure diseases, they may have toresort to a skin biopsy , removing a tiny bit of skin using\\na local anesthetic so that it can examined under a micro-scope. Systemic diseases will require a complete evalua-tion by a physician, including specific tests to identifyand characterize the problem.\\nTreatment\\nSuccessful treatment of underlying causes is most\\nlikely to restore hair growth, be it the completion ofchemotherapy, effective cure of a scalp fungus, or controlof a systemic disease. Two relatively new drugs—minox-idil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Proscar)—promote hairgrowth in a significant minority of patients, especiallythose with male pattern baldness and alopecia areata.While both drugs have so far proved to be quite safewhen used for this purpose, minoxidil is a liquid that is\\napplied to the scalp and finasteride is the first and onlyapproved treatment in a pill form.\\nMinoxidil was approved for over-the-counter sales\\nin 1996.

There is also anover-the-counter extra-strength version of minoxidil (5%concentration) approved for use by men only. The treat-ment often results in new hair that is thinner and lighterin color. It is important to note that new hair stops grow-ing soon after the use of minoxidil is discontinued.\\nOver the past few decades there have appeared a\\nmultitude of hair replacement methods performed byboth physicians and non-physicians. They range fromsimply weaving someone else’s hair in with the remainsof your own to surgically transplanting thousands of hairfollicles one at a time.\\nHair transplantation is completed by taking tiny\\nplugs of skin, each containing one to several hairs,from the back side of the scalp. The bald sections arethen implanted with the plugs. Research completed in2000 looked at the new technique of hair grafting, andfound that micrografts (one to two hairs transplantedper follicle) resulted in fewer complications and thebest results\\nAnother surgical procedure used to treat androgenic\\nalopecia is scalp reduction. By stretching skin the hair-less scalp can be removed and the area of bald skindecreased by closing the space with hair-covered scalp.Hair-bearing skin can also be folded over an area of baldskin with a technique called a flap.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis varies with the cause. It is generally\\nmuch easier to lose hair than to regrow it. Even when itreturns, it is often thin and less attractive than the original.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Society of Health-System Pharmacists Inc.

This screening test mea-\\nsures the level of AFP in the mother’s blood and indi-cates the probability that the fetus has one of several seri-ous birth defects . The level of AFP can also be deter-\\nmined by analyzing a sample of amniotic fluid. Thisscreening test cannot diagnose a specific condition; itonly indicates the increase of risk for several birthdefects. Outside pregnancy, the AFP test is used to detectliver disease, certain cancerous tumors, and to monitorthe progress of cancer treatment.\\nPurpose\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is a substance produced by the\\nliver of a fetus. The exact function of this protein isunknown. After birth, the infant’s liver stops producingAFP, and an adult liver contains only trace amounts.During pregnancy, the fetus excretes AFP in urine andsome of the protein crosses the fetal membranes to enterthe mother’s blood. The level of AFP can then be deter-mined by analyzing a sample of the mother’s blood. Byanalyzing the amount of AFP found in a blood or amni-otic fluid sample, doctors can determine the probabilitythat the fetus is at risk for certain birth defects. It is veryimportant that the doctor know precisely how old thefetus is when the test is performed since the AFP levelchanges over the length of the pregnancy. Alone, AFPscreening cannot diagnose a birth defect. The test isused as an indicator of risk and then an appropriate lineof testing (like amniocentesis or ultrasound) follows,\\nbased on the results.\\nAbnormally high AFP may indicate that the fetus\\nhas an increased risk of a neural tube defect, the mostcommon and severe type of disorder associated withincreased AFP. These types of defects include spinalcolumn defects ( spina bifida ) and anencephaly (a\\nsevere and usually fatal brain abnormality). If the tubethat becomes the brain and spinal cord does not closecorrectly during fetal development, AFP may leakthrough this abnormal opening and enter the amnioticfluid. This leakage creates abnormally high levels ofAFP in amniotic fluid and in maternal blood. If thescreening test indicates abnormally high AFP, ultra-sound is used to diagnosis the problem.\\nOther fetal conditions that can raise AFP levels\\nabove normal include:\\n• cysts at the end of the spine• blockage in the esophagus or intestines\\n• liver disease causing liver cells to die\\n• defects in the abdominal wall• kidney or urinary tract defects or disease\\n• brittle bone disease\\nLevels may also be high if there is too little fluid in\\nthe amniotic sac around the fetus, more than one devel-oping fetus, or a pregnancy that is farther along thanestimated.\\nFor unknown reasons, abnormally low AFP may\\nindicate that the fetus has an increased risk of Down\\nsyndrome . Down syndrome is a condition that\\nincludes mental retardation and a distinctive physical\\nappearance linked to an abnormality of chromosome21 (called trisomy 21). If the screening test indicatesan abnormally low AFP, amniocentesis is used to diag-nosis the problem. Abnormally low levels of AFP canalso occur when the fetus has died or when the motheris overweight.\\nAFP is often part of a “triple check” blood test that\\nanalyzes three substances as risk indicators of possiblebirth defects: AFP, estriol, and human chorionicgonadotropin (HCG). When all three substances are mea-sured in the mother’s blood, the accuracy of the testresults increases.\\nAlthough AFP in human blood gradually disappears\\nafter birth, it never disappears entirely. It may reappear inliver disease, or tumors of the liver, ovaries, or testicles.The AFP test is used to screen people at high risk forthese conditions.

Contin-\\nued high AFP levels suggest the cancer is growing.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is very important that the doctor know precisely\\nhow old the fetus is when the test is performed since theAFP level considered normal changes over the length ofthe pregnancy. Errors in determining the age of the fetuslead to errors when interpreting the test results. Since anAFP test is only a screening tool, more specific testsmust follow to make an accurate diagnosis. An abnormaltest result does not necessarily mean that the fetus has abirth defect. The test has a high rate of abnormal results(either high or low) in order to prevent missing a fetusthat has a serious condition.\\nDescription\\nThe AFP test is usually performed at week 16 of\\npregnancy. Blood is drawn from a vein, usually on theinside of the elbow. AFP can also be measured in the sam-ple of amniotic fluid taken at the time of amniocentesis.Test results are usually available after about one week.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no specific physical preparation for the AFP\\ntest.\\nAftercare\\nThere is no specific aftercare involved with this\\nscreening test.\\nRisks\\nThe risks associated with drawing blood are mini-\\nmal, but may include bleeding from the puncture site,feeling faint or lightheaded after the blood is drawn, orblood accumulating under the puncture site (hematoma).\\nNormal results\\nAlpha-fetoprotein is measured in nanograms per\\nmilliliter (ng/mL) and is expressed as a probability. TheKEY TERMS\\nAmniotic fluid —Fluid within the uterine sac in\\nwhich the fetus lives until born.\\nFetus —The stage in human development from the\\nsecond month of pregnancy until birth.probability (1:100, for example) translates into the\\nchance that the fetus has a defect (a one in 100 chance,for example).\\nWhen testing for cancer or liver diseases, AFP\\nresults are reported as nanograms per milliliter. An AFPlevel less than or equal to 50 ng/mL is considered nor-mal.\\nAbnormal results\\nThe doctor will inform the woman of her specific\\nincreased risk as compared to the “normal” risk of a stan-dard case. If the risk of Down syndrome is greater thanthe standard risk for women who are 35 years old orolder (one in 270), then amniocentesis is recommended.Again, the test has a high rate of showing an abnormalAFP level in order to prevent missing a fetus that hasDown’s syndrome. This screening test only predicts risk;appropriate diagnostic testing will follow after an abnor-mal screening result.\\nIn tumor or liver disease testing, an AFP level\\ngreater than 50 ng/mL is considered abnormal.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCunningham, Gary, et al.

This causes vasodilation and allowsblood to flow more easily.\\nPurpose\\nThese drugs, called alpha blockers for short, are\\nused for two main purposes: to treat high blood pressure(hypertension ) and to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia\\n(BPH), a condition that affects men and is characterizedby an enlarged prostate gland.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nHigh blood pressure puts a strain on the heart and\\nthe arteries. Over time, hypertension can damage theblood vessels to the point of causing stroke ,heart fail-\\nureor kidney failure. People with high blood pressure\\nmay also be at higher risk for heart attacks. Controllinghigh blood pressure makes these problems less likely.Alpha blockers help lower blood pressure by causingvasodilation, meaning an increase in the diameter of theblood vessels, which allows blood to flow more easily.\\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)\\nThis condition particularly affects older men. Over\\ntime, the prostate, a donut-shaped gland below the blad-der, enlarges. When this happens, it may interfere withthe passage of urine from the bladder out of the body.Men who are diagnosed with BPH may have to urinatemore often. Or they may feel that they can not complete-ly empty their bladders. Alpha blockers inhibit the con-traction of prostatic smooth muscle and thus relax mus-cles in the prostate and the bladder, allowing urine toflow more freely.\\nDescription\\nCommonly prescribed alpha blockers for hyperten-\\nsion and BPH include doxazosin (Cardura, prazosin(Minipress) and terazosin (Hytrin). Prazosin is also usedin the treatment of heart failure. All are available onlywith a physician’s prescription and are sold in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the patient and\\nthe type of alpha blocker and may change over the courseof treatment. The prescribing physician will graduallyincrease the dosage, if necessary. Some patients may needas much as 15-20 mg per day of terazosin, 16 mg per dayof doxazosin, or as much as 40 mg per day of prazosin,but most people benefit from lower doses. As the dosageincreases, so does the possibility of unwanted side effects.\\nAlpha blockers should be taken exactly as directed,\\neven if the medication does not seem to be working atfirst. It should not be stopped even if symptoms improvebecause it needs to be taken regularly to be effective.Patients should avoid missing any doses, and should nottake larger or more frequent doses to make up formissed doses.\\nPrecautions\\nAlpha blockers may lower blood pressure to a\\ngreater extent than desired. This can cause dizziness ,\\nlightheadedness, heart palpitations , and fainting . Activ-\\nities such as driving, using machines, or doing anythingelse that might be dangerous for 24 hours after taking thefirst dose should be avoided. Patients should be remindedto be especially careful not to fall when getting up in themiddle of the night. The same precautions are recom-mended if the dosage is increased or if the drug has beenstopped and then started again. Anyone whose safety onthe job could be affected by taking alpha blockers shouldinform his or her physician, so that the physician cantake this factor into account when increasing dosage.\\nDizziness, lightheadedness, and fainting are more like-\\nly to occur when people taking alpha blockers also drinkalcohol, exercise , stand for a long time, or are exposed to\\nhot weather. Extra care should be used under these condi-tions and alcohol consumption should be limited.\\nSome people may feel drowsy or less alert when\\nusing these drugs.

All varieties of the syndromeare characterized by kidney disease that usually pro-gresses to chronic kidney failure and by uremia (the\\npresence of excessive amounts of urea and other wasteproducts in the blood).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlport syndrome in most cases is caused by a defect\\nin one or more genes located on the X chromosome. It isusually inherited from the mother, who is a normal carri-er. However, in up to 20% of cases there is no family his-tory of the disorder. In these cases, there appears to be aspontaneous genetic mutation causing Alport syndrome.\\nBlood in the urine (hematuria) is a hallmark of\\nAlport syndrome. Other symptoms that may appear invarying combinations include:\\n• protein in the urine (proteinuria)• sensorineural hearing loss• eye problems [involuntary, rhythmic eye movements\\n(nystagmus ),cataracts , or cornea problems]\\n• skin problems• platelet disorders• abnormal white blood cells• smooth muscle tumorsKEY TERMS\\nAlbumin —A protein that is important in maintain-\\ning blood volume.

Although testing is fairly expensive, it is covered bymany types of health insurance. DNA tests can diagnoseaffected children even before birth, and genetic linkagetests tracing all family members at risk for Alport syn-drome are also available.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no specific treatment that can “cure” Alport\\nsyndrome.

High altitude is defined asheight greater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m); medium altitudeis defined as height between 5,000 and 8,000 feet(1,524–2,438 m); and extreme altitude is defined asheight greater than 19,000 feet (5,791 m). The majorityof healthy individuals suffer from altitude sickness whenthey reach very high altitudes. In addition, about 20% ofpeople ascending above 9,000 (2,743 m) feet in one daywill develop altitude sickness. Children under six yearsand women in the premenstrual part of their cycles maybe more vulnerable. Individuals with preexisting medicalconditions—even a minor respiratory infection—maybecome sick at more moderate altitudes.\\nDescription\\nThere are three major clinical syndromes that fall\\nunder the heading of altitude sickness: acute mountainsickness (AMS), high-altitude pulmonary edema\\n(HAPE), and high-altitude cerebral edema (HACE).\\nThese syndromes are not separate, individual syndromesas much as they are a continuum of severity, all resultingfrom a decrease in oxygen in the air. AMS is the mildest,and the other two represent severe, life-threatening formsof altitude sickness.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 132Altitude sicknessGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 132'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 146}, page_content='Altitude sickness occurs because the partial pressure\\nof oxygen decreases with altitude. (Partial pressure is aterm applied to gases that is similar to the way the termconcentration is applied to liquid solutions.) For instance,at 18,000 feet (5,486 m) the partial pressure of oxygendrops to one-half its value at sea level and, therefore, thereis a substantially lower amount of oxygen available for theindividual to inhale. This is known as hypoxia. Further-more, since there is less oxygen to inhale, less oxygenreaches the blood. This is known as hypoxemia. These twoconditions are the major factors that form the basis for allthe medical problems associated with altitude sickness.\\nAs a person becomes hypoxemic, his natural\\nresponse is to breathe more rapidly (hyperventilate). Thisis the body’s attempt to bring in more oxygen at a rapidrate. This attempt at alleviating the effects of the hypoxiaat higher altitudes is known as acclimatization, and itoccurs during the first few days. Acclimatization is aresponse that occurs in individuals who travel from lowerto higher altitudes. There are groups of people who havelived at high altitudes (for example, in the Himalayanand Andes mountains) for generations, and they are sim-ply accustomed to living at such altitudes, perhapsthrough a genetic ability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute mountain sickness (AMS) is a mild form of\\naltitude sickness that results from ascent to altitudes highergreater than 8,000 feet (2,438 m)—even 6,500 feet (1,981m) in some susceptible individuals. Although hypoxia isassociated with the development of AMS, the exact mech-anism by which this condition develops has yet to be con-firmed. It is important to realize that some individualsacclimatize to higher altitudes more efficiently than others.As a result, under similar conditions some will suffer fromAMS while others will not. At present, the susceptibilityof otherwise healthy individuals to contracting AMS can-not be accurately predicted. Of those who do suffer fromAMS, the condition tends to be most severe on the secondor third day after reaching the high altitude, and it usuallyabates after three to five days if they remain at the samealtitude. However, it can recur if the individuals travel toan even higher altitude. Symptoms usually appear a fewhours to a few days following ascent, and they includedizziness ,headache ,shortness of breath , nausea, vomit-\\ning, loss of appetite, and insomnia .\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is a life-\\nthreatening condition that afflicts a small percentage ofthose who suffer from AMS. In this condition, fluid leaksfrom within the pulmonary blood vessels into the lungtissue. As this fluid begins to accumulate within the lungtissue (pulmonary edema), the individual begins toKEY TERMS\\nCerebral —Pertaining to the brain.\\nEdema —Accumulation of excess fluid in the tis-\\nsues of the body.\\nHypoxemia —Insufficient oxygenation of the blood.\\nHypoxia —A deficiency in the amount of oxygen\\nrequired for effective ventilation.\\nPulmonary —Pertaining to the lungs.\\nbecome more and more short of breath. HAPE is known\\nto afflict all types of individuals, regardless of their levelof physical fitness.\\nTypically, the individual who suffers from HAPE\\nascends quickly to a high altitude and almost immediate-ly develops shortness of breath, a rapid heart rate, acough productive of a large amount of sometimes bloody\\nsputum, and a rapid rate of breathing. If no medical assis-tance is provided by this point, the patient goes into acoma and dies within a few hours.\\nHigh-altitude cerebral edema (HACE), the rarest and\\nmost severe form of altitude sickness, involves cerebraledema, and its mechanism of development is also poorlyunderstood. The symptoms often begin with those ofAMS, but neurologic symptoms such as an altered levelof consciousness, speech abnormalities, severe headache,loss of coordination, hallucinations , and even seizures.\\nIf no intervention is implemented, death is the result.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis for altitude sickness may be made\\nfrom the observation of the individual’s symptoms dur-ing travel to higher altitudes.\\nTreatment\\nMild AMS requires no treatment other than an\\naspirin or ibuprofen for headache, and avoidance of fur-\\nther ascent. Narcotics should be avoided because theymay blunt the respiratory response, making it even moredifficult for the person to breathe deeply and rapidlyenough to compensate for the lower levels of oxygen inthe environment. Oxygen may also be used to alleviatesymptoms of mild AMS.\\nAs for HAPE and HACE, the most important course\\nof action is descent to a lower altitude as soon as possi-ble.

If descent is not\\npossible, oxygen therapy should be started. In addition,dexamethasone (a steroid) has been suggested in order toreduce cerebral edema.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for mild AMS is good, if appropriate\\nmeasures are taken. As for HAPE and HACE, the prog-nosis depends upon the rapidity and distance of descentand the availability of medical intervention. Descentoften leads to improvement of symptoms, however,recovery times vary among individuals.\\nPrevention\\nWhen individuals ascend from sea level, it is recom-\\nmended that they spend at least one night at an interme-diate altitude prior to ascending to higher elevations. Ingeneral, climbers should take at least two days to gofrom sea level to 8,000 feet (2,438 m). After reachingthat point, healthy climbers should generally allow oneday for each additional 2,000 feet (610 m), and one dayof rest should be taken every two or three days. Shouldmild symptoms begin to surface, further ascent should beavoided. If the symptoms are severe, the individualshould return to a lower altitude. Some reports indicatethat acetazolamide (a diuretic) may be taken beforeascent as a preventative measure for AMS.\\nPaying attention to diet can also help prevent alti-\\ntude sickness. Water loss is a problem at higher altitudes,so climbers should drink ample water (enough to pro-duce copious amounts of relatively light-colored or clearurine). Alcohol and large amounts of salt should beavoided. Eating frequent small, high-carbohydratesnacks (for example, fruits, jams and starchy foods) canhelp, especially in the first few days of climbing.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCrystal, R. G., ed., et al.

AD usually occurs in old age, andis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such asremembering, reasoning, and planning.\\nDescription\\nA person with AD usually has a gradual decline in\\nmental functions, often beginning with slight memoryloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintainemployment, to plan and execute familiar tasks, and toreason and exercise judgment. Communication ability,\\nmood, and personality may also be affected. Most peoplewho have AD die within eight years of their diagnosis,although that interval may be as short as one year or aslong as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of death\\nin adults after heart disease, cancer , and stroke .\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD;\\nthat number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million bythe middle of the 21st century as the population as a wholeages. While a small number of people in their 40s and 50sdevelop the disease (called early-onset AD), AD predomi-nantly affects the elderly. AD affects about 3% of all peoplebetween ages 65 and 74, about 19% of those between 75and 84, and about 47% of those over 85. Slightly morewomen than men are affected with AD, but this may bebecause women tend to live longer, and so there is a higherproportion of women in the most affected age groups.\\nThe costs for caring for a person with AD is consid-\\nerable. The annual cost of caring for one AD patient in1998 was estimated as about $18,400 for a patient withmild AD, $30,100 for a patient with moderate AD, and$36,100 for a patient with severe AD. The annual directand indirect costs of caring for AD patients in the UnitedStates was estimated to be as much as $100 billion.Slightly more than half of AD patients are cared for athome, while the remainder are cared for in a variety ofhealth care institutions.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause or causes of Alzheimer’s disease are\\nunknown. Some strong leads have been found throughrecent research, however, and these have also given sometheoretical support to several new experimental treatments.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 134Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 134'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content='At first AD destroys neurons (nerve cells) in parts of\\nthe brain that control memory, including the hippocam-pus, which is a structure deep in the deep that controlsshort-term memory. As these neurons in the hippocampusstop functioning, the short-term memory of the personfails, and the ability to perform familiar tasks decreases.Later AD affects the cerebral cortex, particularly the areasresponsible for language and reasoning; this languageskills are lost and the ability to make judgments ischanged. Personality changes occur, which may includeemotional outbursts, wandering, and agitation. The sever-ity of these changes increases with the progression of thedisease. Eventually many other areas of the brain becomeinvolved, the brain regions affected atrophy (shrink andlose function), and the person with AD becomes bedrid-den, incontinent, helpless, and non-responsive.\\nAutopsy of a person with AD shows that the regions\\nof the brain affected by the disease become clogged withtwo abnormal structures, called neurofibrillary tanglesand amyloid plaques. Neurofibrillary tangles are twistedmasses of protein fibers inside nerve cells, or neurons. InAD, tau proteins, which normally help bind and stabilizeparts of neurons, is changed chemically, become twistedand tangled, and no longer can stabilize the neurons.Amyloid plaques consist of insoluble deposits of beta-amyloid (a protein fragment from a larger protein calledamyloid precursor protein (APP) mixed with parts of neu-rons and non-nerve cells. Plaques are found in the spacesbetween the nerve cells of the brain. While it is not clearexactly how these structures cause problems, manyresearchers believe that their formation is responsible forthe mental changes of AD, presumably by interferingwith the normal communication between neurons in thebrain and later leading to the death of neurons. As of2000, three drugs for the treatment of AD symptoms havebeen approved by the United States Food and DrugAdministration (FDA). They act by increasing the level ofchemical signaling molecules in the brain, known as neu-rotransmitters, to make up for this decreased communica-tion ability. All act by inhibiting the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase, which is an enzyme that breaks downacetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter released byneurons that is necessary for cognitive function. Thesedrugs modestly increase cognition and improve one’sability to perform normal activities of daily living.\\nWhat triggers the formation of plaques and tangles\\nand the development of AD are unknown. AD likelyresults from many interrelated factors, including genetic,environmental, and others not yet identified. Two typesof AD exist: familial AD (FAD), which is a rare autoso-mal dominant inherited disease, and sporadic AD, withno obvious inheritance pattern. AD is also described interms of age at onset, with early on-set AD occurring inpeople younger than 65, and late-onset occurring in those\\n65 and older. Early on-set AD comprises about 5-10 ofAD cases and affects people aged 30 to 60. Some casesof early on-set AD are inherited and are common in somefamilies. Early-onset AD often progresses faster than themore common late-on-set type.\\nAll FAD, which are relatively uncommon, that have\\nbeen identified so far are the early on-set type. As manyas 50% of the FAD cases are known to be caused by threegenes located on three different chromosomes. Somefamilies have mutations in the APP gene located on chro-mosome 21, which causes the production of abnormalAPP protein. Others have mutations in a gene called pre-senilin 1 located on chromosome 14, which causes theproduction of abnormal presenilin 1 protein, and othershave mutations in a similar gene called presenilin 2 locat-ed on chromosome 1, which causes production of abnor-mal presenilin 2. Presenilin 1 may be one of the enzymesthat clips APP into beta-amyloid; it may also be importantin the synaptic connections between brain cells.\\nThere is no evidence that the mutated genes that\\ncause early on-set FAD also cause late on-set AD, butgenetics does appear to play a role in this more commonform of AD. Discovered by researchers at Duke Univer-sity in the early 1990s, potentially the most importantgenetic link to AD was on chromosome 19. A gene onthis chromosome, called APOE (apolipoprotein E), codesfor a protein involved in transporting lipids into neurons.APOE occurs in at least three forms (alleles), calledAPOE e2, APOE e3, and APOE e4. Each person inheritsone APOE from each parent, and therefore can eitherhave one copy of two different forms, or two copies ofone. The relatively rare APOE e2 appears to protect somepeople from AD, as it seems to be associated with alower risk of AD and a later age of onset if AD doesdevelop. APOE e3 is the most common version found inthe general population, and only appears to have a neu-tral role in AD. However, APOE e4 appears to increasethe risk of developing late onset AD with the inheritanceof one or two copies of APOE e4. Compared to thosewithout APOE e4, people with one copy are about threetimes as likely to develop late-onset AD, and those withtwo copies are almost four times as likely to do so. Hav-ing APOE e4 can also lower the age of onset by as muchas 17 years. However, APOE e4 only increases the risk ofdeveloping AD and does not cause it, as not everyonewith APOE e4 develops AD, and people without it canstill have the disease. Why APOE e4 increases thechances of developing AD is not known with certainty.However, one theory is that APOE e4 facilitates beta-amyloid buildup in plaques, thus contributing to the low-ering of the age of onset of AD; other theories involveinteractions with cholesterol levels and effects on nerve\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 135Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 135'),\n",

In\\n2000, four new AD-related regions in the human genomewere identified, where one out of several hundred genesin each of these regions may be a risk factor gene for AD.These genes, which are not yet identified, appear to makea contribution to the risk of developing late-onset ADthat is at least as important as APOE e4.\\nOther non-genetic factors have also been studied in\\nrelation to the causes of AD. Inflammation of the brainmay play a role in development of AD, and use of nons-\\nteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) seems to\\nreduce the risk of developing AD. Restriction of bloodflow may be part of the problem, perhaps accounting forthe beneficial effects of estrogen, which increases bloodflow in the brain, among its other effects. Highly reactivemolecular fragments called free radicals damage cells ofall kinds, especially brain cells, which have smaller sup-plies of protective antioxidants thought to protect againstfree radical damage. Vitamin E is one such antioxidant,and its use in AD may be of possible theoretical benefit.\\nWhile the ultimate cause or causes of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease are still unknown, there are several risk factorsthat increase a person’s likelihood of developing the dis-ease. The most significant one is, of course, age; olderpeople develop AD at much higher rates than youngerones. There is some evidence that strokes and AD may belinked, with small strokes that go undetected clinicallycontributing to the injury of neurons. Blood cholesterollevels may also be important. Scientists have shown thathigh blood cholesterol levels in special breeds of geneti-cally engineered (transgenic) mice may increase the rateof plaque deposition. There are also parallels betweenAD and other progressive neurodegenerative disordersthat cause dementia, including prion diseases, Parkin-son’s disease, and Huntington’s disease.\\nNumerous epidemiological studies of populations are\\nalso being conducted to learn more about whether and towhat extent early life events, socioeconomic factors, andethnicity have an impact on the development of AD. Forexample, results from one study indicated that rural resi-dence in childhood, along with fewer than six years ofschooling, was associated with increased AD risk. How-ever, the low educational attainment that was identified asa risk factor might be a marker or surrogate for other dele-terious socioeconomic or environmental influences inchildhood, thus illustrating the difficulties in interpretingepidemiological findings, due to the complexity of theissues and the large number of variables involved.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected of\\ncontributing to AD, but epidemiological population stud-ies have not borne out these links. Among these havebeen pollutants in drinking water, aluminum from com-mercial products, and metal dental fillings. To date, none\\nof these factors has been shown to cause AD or increaseits likelihood. Further research may yet turn up links toother environmental factors.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease begin gradu-\\nally, usually with memory lapses. Occasional memorylapses are of course common to everyone, and do not bythemselves signify any change in cognitive function. Theperson with AD may begin with only the routine sort ofmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—butprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such asforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becominglost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhoodbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A personwith AD may forget the names of family members, orforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence bythe time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-\\ning inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,and personality or behavior changes. Some patients havetrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-tion in the evening (“sunsetting” or Sundowner’s Syn-drome). In some cases, people with AD repeat the sameideas, movements, words, or thoughts, a behavior knownas perseveration. In the final stages people may havesevere problems with eating, communicating, and con-trolling their bladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of ten\\nwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-toms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:\\n• memory loss that affects job skills\\n• difficulty performing familiar tasks• problems with language\\n• disorientation of time and place\\n• poor or decreased judgment• problems with abstract thinking\\n• misplacing things\\n• changes in mood or behavior\\n• changes in personality\\n• loss of initiative\\nOther types of dementia, including some that are\\nreversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is important forthe person with these symptoms to be evaluated by a pro-fessional who can weigh the possibility that his or hersymptoms may have another cause. Approximately 20% ofthose originally suspected of having AD turn out to havesome other disorder; about half of these cases are treatable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 136Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 136'),\n",

Except in thedisease’s earliest stages, accurate history from familymembers or caregivers is essential. Since there are bothprescription and over-the-counter drugs that can causethe same mental changes as AD, a careful review of thepatient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.AD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-ical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-tia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).These possibilities must be ruled out as well throughappropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography\\n(PET ) or single photon emission computed tomography\\n(SPECT) scans, tests of the brain’s electrical activity(electroencephalographs or EEGs), or other tests. Severaltypes of oral and written tests are used to aid in the ADdiagnosis and to follow its progression, including tests ofmental status, functional abilities, memory, and concen-tration. Still, the neurologic exam is normal in most\\npatients in early stages.\\nOne of the most important parts of the diagnostic\\nprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression anddelirium , since each of these can be present with AD,\\nor may be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves adecreased consciousness or awareness of one’s environ-ment.) Depression and memory loss are both commonin the elderly, and the combination of the two can oftenbe mistaken for AD. Depression can be treated withdrugs, although some antidepressants can worsendementia if it is present, further complicating both diag-nosis and treatment.\\nAn early and accurate diagnosis of AD is important\\nin developing strategies for managing symptoms and forhelping patients and their families planning for the futureand pursuing care options while the patient can still takepart in the decision-making process.\\nA genetic test for the APOE e4 gene is available, but\\nis not used for diagnosis, since possessing even twocopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD. Inaddition, access to genetic information could affect theinsurability of a patient if disclosed, and also affectemployment status and legal rights.Treatment\\nAlzheimer’s disease is presently incurable, so there-\\nfore the mainstay of treatment for a person with AD isgood nursing care, providing both physical and emotion-al support for a person who is gradually able to do lessand less for himself, and whose behavior is becomingmore and more erratic. Modifications of the home toincrease safety and security are often necessary. Thecaregiver also needs support to prevent anger, despair,and burnout from becoming overwhelming. Becomingfamiliar with the issues likely to lie ahead, and consider-ing the appropriate financial and legal issues early on,can help both the patient and family cope with the diffi-cult process of the disease. Regular medical care by apractitioner with a non-defeatist attitude toward AD isimportant so that illnesses such as urinary or respiratoryinfections can be diagnosed and treated properly, ratherthan being incorrectly attributed to the inevitable declineseen in AD.\\nPeople with AD are also often depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition , and\\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is treatableto some degree. It is important for the person with AD toeat well and continue to exercise. Professional advicefrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,easy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable tothose requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise(supervised if necessary for safety) promotes overallhealth. A calm, structured environment with simple ori-entation aids (such as calendars and clocks) may reduceanxiety and increase safety. Other psychiatric symptoms,\\nsuch as depression, anxiety, hallucinations (seeing or\\nhearing things that aren’t there), and delusions (false\\nbeliefs) may be treated with drugs if necessary.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 137Alzheimer’s disease\\nDiseased tissue from the brain of an Alzheimer’s patient\\nshowing senile plaques within the brain’s gray matter.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 151}, page_content='Drugs\\nAs of 2000, only three drugs—tacrine (Cognex),\\ndonepezil hydrochloride (Aricept), and rivastigmine(Exelon)—have been approved by the FDA for its treat-ment. Tacrine has been shown to be effective for improv-ing memory skills, but only in patients with mild-to-mod-erate AD, and even then in less than half of those who takeit. Its beneficial effects are usually mild and temporary, butit may delay the need for nursing home admission. Themost significant side effect is an increase in a liver enzymeknown as alanine aminotransferase, or ALT. Patients tak-ing tacrine must have a weekly blood test to monitor theirALT levels. Other frequent side effects include nausea,vomiting, diarrhea , abdominal pain ,indigestion , and\\nskin rash. The cost of tacrine was about $125 per month inearly 1998, with additional costs for the weekly bloodmonitoring. Despite its high cost, tacrine appears to becost-effective for those who respond to it, since it maydecrease the number of months a patient needs nursingcare. Donepezil is the drug most commonly used to treatmild to moderate symptoms of AD, although it only helpssome patients for periods of time ranging from months toabout two years. Donepezil has two advantages overtacrine: it has fewer side effects, and it can be given oncedaily rather than three times daily. Donepezil does notappear to affect liver enzymes, and therefore does notrequire weekly blood tests. The frequency of abdominalside effects is also lower. The monthly cost is approxi-mately the same. Rivastigmine, approved for use in Aprilof 2000, has been shown to improve the ability of patientsto carry out daily activities, such as eating and dressing,decrease behavioral symptoms such as delusions and agi-tation, and improve cognitive functions such as thinking,memory, and speaking. The cost is similar to those of theother two drugs. However, none of these three drugs stopsor reverses the progression of AD.\\nEstrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-\\nscribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo-\\nporosis . Several preliminary studies have shown that\\nwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and thosewho develop AD have a slower progression and lesssevere symptoms.However, estrogen does not appear tohave a beneficial effect on women who already have AD.\\nPreliminary studies have also suggested a reduced\\nrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly usenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-ing aspirin , ibuprofen, and naproxen, although not aceta-\\nminophen.Inflammation of the brain is a distinctive char-acteristic of AD, but whether it is a cause or an effect ofthe disease is not yet known.\\nAntioxidants, which act to inhibit and protect\\nagainst oxidative damage caused by free radicals, havebeen shown to inhibit toxic effects of beta-amyloid in tis-\\nsue culture. Therefore, research is being conducted to seewhether antioxidants may delay or prevent AD.\\nAnother antioxidant, vitamin E, is also thought to\\ndelay AD onset. It is not yet clear whether this is due tothe specific action of vitamin E on brain cells, or to anincrease in the overall health of those taking it.\\nDrugs such as antidepressants, anti-psychotics, and\\nsedatives are used to treat the behavioral symptoms(agitation, aggression, wandering, and sleep disorders )\\nof AD. Research is being conducted to search for bettertreatments, including non-drug approaches for ADpatients.\\nNursing care and safety\\nThe person with Alzheimer’s disease will gradually\\nlose the ability to dress, groom, feed, bathe, or use thetoilet by himself; in the later stages of the disease, hemay be unable to move or speak. In addition, the per-son’s behavior becomes increasing erratic. A tendency towander may make it difficult to leave him unattended foreven a few minutes and make even the home a potentiallydangerous place. In addition, some patients may exhibitinappropriate sexual behaviors.\\nThe nursing care required for a person with AD is\\nwell within the abilities of most people to learn. The dif-ficulty for many caregivers comes in the constant butunpredictable nature of the demands put on them. Inaddition, the personality changes undergone by a personwith AD can be heartbreaking for family members, as aloved one deteriorates, seeming to become a differentperson. Not all AD patients develop negative behaviors:some become quite gentle, and spend increasing amountsof time in dreamlike states.\\nA loss of good grooming may be one of the early\\nsymptoms of AD. Mismatched clothing, unkempt hair,and decreased interest in personal hygiene become morecommon. Caregivers, especially spouses, may find thesechanges socially embarrassing and difficult to cope with.The caregiver will usually need to spend increasingamounts of time for grooming to compensate for the lossof attention from the patient, although some adjustmentof expectations (while maintaining cleanliness) is oftenneeded as the disease progresses.\\nProper nutrition is important for a person with AD,\\nand may require assisted feeding early on, to make sure theperson is taking in enough nutrients. Later on, as move-ment and swallowing become difficult, a feeding tube maybe placed into the stomach through the abdominal wall. Afeeding tube requires more attention, but is generally easyto care for if the patient is not resistant to its use.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 138Alzheimer’s diseaseGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 138'),\n",

In theearly stages, limiting fluid intake and increasing the fre-quency of toileting can help. Careful attention to hygieneis important to prevent skin irritation and infection fromsoiled clothing.\\nPersons with dementia must deal with six basic safe-\\nty concerns: injury from falls, injury from ingesting dan-gerous substances, leaving the home and getting lost,injury to self or others from sharp objects, fire or burns ,\\nand the inability to respond rapidly to crisis situations. Inall cases, a person diagnosed with AD should no longerbe allowed to drive, because of the increased potentialfor accidents and the increased likelihood of wanderingvery far from home while disoriented. In the home, sim-ple measures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed railson the bed, and easily negotiable passageways can great-ly increase safety. Electrical appliances should beunplugged and put away when not in use, and matches,lighters, knives, or weapons should be stored safely outof reach. The hot water heater temperature may be setlower to prevent accidental scalding. A list of emergencynumbers, including the poison control center and thehospital emergency room, should be posted by thephone. As the disease progresses, caregivers need to peri-odically reevaluate the physical safety of the home andintroduce new strategies for continued safety.\\nCare for the caregiver\\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\\nAD have an extremely difficult and stressful job, whichbecomes harder as the disease progresses. Dementiacaregivers spend significantly more time on caregivingthan do people providing care for those with other typesof illnesses. This type of caregiving also has a greaterimpact in terms of employment complications, caregiverstrain, mental and physical health problems, time forleisure and other family members, and family conflictthan do other types of caregiving. It is common for ADcaregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,and hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel fortheir loved one and for themselves. Depression is anextremely common consequence of being a full-timecaregiver for a person with AD. Support groups are animportant way to deal with the stress of caregiving.\\nBecoming a member of an AD caregivers’ support groupcan be one of the most important things a family memberdoes, not only for him or herself, but for the person withAD as well. The location and contact numbers for ADcaregiver support groups are available from theAlzheimer’s Association; they may also be availablethrough a local social service agency, the patient’s physi-cian, or pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the\\ndrugs used to treat AD. Medical treatment for depressionmay be an important adjunct to group support.\\nOutside help, nursing homes, and governmental\\nassistance\\nMost families eventually need outside help to relieve\\nsome of the burden of around-the-clock care for a personwith AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer orpaid, may be available through local social service agen-cies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasinglycommon. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respitecare may be available as well.\\nProviding the total care required by a person with\\nlate-stage AD can become an overwhelming burden for afamily, even with outside help. At this stage, many fami-lies consider nursing home care. This decision is often oneof the most difficult for the family, since it is often seen asan abandonment of the loved one and a failure of the fami-ly. Careful counseling with a sympathetic physician, cler-gy, or other trusted adviser may ease the difficulties of thistransition. Selecting a nursing home may require a difficultbalancing of cost, services, location, and availability.Keeping the entire family involved in the decision mayhelp prevent further stress from developing later on.\\nSeveral federal government programs may ease the\\ncost of caring for a person with AD, including SocialSecurity Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Securi-ty Income. Each of these programs may provide someassistance for care, medication, or other costs, but noneof them will pay for nursing home care indefinitely.Medicaid is a state-funded program that may provide forsome or all of the cost of nursing home care, althoughthere are important restrictions. Details of the benefitsand eligibility requirements of these programs are avail-able through the local Social Security or Medicaid office,or from local social service agencies.\\nPrivate long-term care insurance, special “reverse\\nmortgages,” viatical insurance, and other financial devicesare other ways of paying for care for those with the appro-priate financial situations. Further information on theseoptions may be available through resources listed below.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral substances are currently being tested for\\ntheir ability to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s disease.These include acetylcarnitine, a supplement that acts onthe cellular energy structures known as mitochondria.Ginkgo extract, derived from the leaves of the Ginkgo\\nbiloba tree, appears to have antioxidant as well as anti-\\ninflammatory and anticoagulant properties.

It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaningthat when a decrease in vision is detected, other causesmust be ruled out. Once no other cause is found, ambly-opia is the diagnosis. Generally, a difference of two linesor more (on an eye-chart test of visual acuity) betweenthe two eyes or a best corrected vision of 20/30 or worsewould be defined as amblyopia. For example, if someonehas 20/20 vision with the right eye and only 20/40 withthe left, and the left eye cannot achieve better vision withcorrective lenses, the left eye is said to be amblyopic.\\nDescription\\nLazy eye is a common non-medical term used to\\ndescribe amblyopia because the eye with poorer visiondoesn’t seem to be doing its job of seeing. Amblyopia isthe most common cause of impaired vision in children,affecting nearly three out of every 100 people or 2-4%of the population. Vision is a combination of the clarityof the images of the eyes (visual acuity) and the process-ing of those images by the brain. If the images producedby the two eyes are substantially different, the brain maynot be able to fuse the images. Instead of seeing two dif-ferent images or double vision (diplopia), the brain sup-presses the blurrier image. This suppression can lead toamblyopia. During the first few years of life, preferringone eye over the other may lead to poor visual develop-ment in the blurrier eye.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSome of the major causes of amblyopia are as follows:•Strabismus . A misalignment of the eyes (strabismus) is\\nthe most common cause of functional amblyopia. Thetwo eyes are looking in two different directions at thesame time. The brain is sent two different images andthis causes confusion. Images from the misaligned or“crossed” eye are turned off to avoid double vision.\\n• Anisometropia. This is another type of functional\\namblyopia. In this case, there is a difference of refrac-tive states between the two eyes (in other words, a dif-ference of prescriptions between the two eyes). Forexample, one eye may be more nearsighted than theother eye, or one eye may be farsighted and the othereye nearsighted. Because the brain cannot fuse the twodissimilar images, the brain will suppress the blurrierimage, causing the eye to become amblyopic.\\n• Cataract. Clouding of the lens of the eye will cause the\\nimage to be blurrier than the other eye. The brain“prefers” the clearer image. The eye with the cataractmay become amblyopic.\\n•Ptosis . This is the drooping of the upper eyelid. If light\\ncannot enter the eye because of the drooping lid, theeye is essentially not being used. This can lead toamblyopia.\\n•Nutrition . A type of organic amblyopia in which nutri-\\ntional deficiencies or chemical toxicity may result inamblyopia. Alcohol, tobacco, or a deficiency in the Bvitamins may result in toxic amblyopia.\\n• Heredity. Amblyopia can run in families.\\nBarring the presence of strabismus or ptosis, chil-\\ndren may or may not show signs of amblyopia. Childrenmay hold their heads at an angle while trying to favor theeye with normal vision. They may have trouble seeing orreaching for things when approached from the side of theamblyopic eye.

If an infant’s\\ngood eye is covered, the child may cry.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause children with outwardly normal eyes may\\nhave amblyopia, it is important to have regular visionscreenings performed for all children. While there issome controversy regarding the age children should havetheir first vision examination, their eyes can, in actuality,be examined at any age, even at one day of life.\\nSome recommend that children have their vision\\nchecked by their pediatrician, family physician, ophthal-mologist, or optometrist at or before six months of age.Others recommend testing by at least the child’s fourthbirthday. There may be a “critical period” in the develop-ment of vision, and amblyopia may not be treatable afterage eight or nine. The earlier amblyopia is found, the betterthe possible outcome. Most physicians test vision as part ofa child’s medical examination. If there is any sign of an eyeproblem, they may refer a child to an eye specialist.\\nThere are objective methods, such as retinoscopy, to\\nmeasure the refractive status of the eyes. This can helpdetermine anisometropia. In retinoscopy, a hand-heldinstrument is used to shine a light in the child’s (orinfant’s) eyes. Using hand-held lenses, a rough prescrip-tion can be obtained. Visual acuity can be determinedusing a variety of methods. Many different eye charts areavailable (e.g., tumbling E, pictures, or letters).

Neutral density filtersmay also be held over the eye to aid in the diagnosis.Sometimes visual fields to determine defects in the areaof vision will be performed. Color vision testing may alsobe performed. Again, it must be emphasized that ambly-opia is a diagnosis of exclusion. Visual or life-threateningproblems can also cause a decrease in vision. An exami-nation of the eyes and visual system is very importantwhen there is an unexplained decrease in vision.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary treatment for amblyopia is occlusion\\ntherapy. It is important to alternate patching the good eye(forcing the amblyopic eye to work) and the amblyopiceye. If the good eye is constantly patched, it too maybecome amblyopic because of disuse. The treatment planshould be discussed with the doctor to fully understandhow long the patch will be on. When patched, eye exercis-es may be prescribed to force the amblyopic eye to focusand work. This is called vision therapy or vision training\\n(eye exercises). Even after vision has been restored in theweak eye, part-time patching may be required over a peri-od of years to maintain the improvement.\\nWhile patching is necessary to get the amblyopic\\neye to work, it is just as important to correct the reasonfor the amblyopia. Glasses may also be worn if there areerrors in refraction. Surgery or vision training may benecessary in the case of strabismus. Better nutrition isindicated in some toxic amblyopias. Occasionally,amblyopia is treated by blurring the vision in the goodeye with eye drops or lenses to force the child to use theamblyopic eye.\\nPrognosis\\nThe younger the person, the better the chance for\\nimprovement with occlusion and vision therapy. Howev-er, treatment may be successful in older children—evenadults. Success in the treatment of amblyopia alsodepends upon how severe the amblyopia is, the specifictype of amblyopia, and patient compliance. It is impor-tant to diagnose and treat amblyopia early because sig-nificant vision loss can occur if left untreated. The bestoutcomes result from early diagnosis and treatment.\\nPrevention\\nTo protect their child’s vision, parents must be aware\\nof amblyopia as a potential problem. This awareness mayencourage parents to take young children for vision examsearly on in life—certainly before school age. Proper nutri-tion is important in the avoidance of toxic amblyopia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 142AmblyopiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 142'),\n",

Persons with amebiasis may experi-\\nence a wide range of symptoms, including diarrhea ,\\nfever , and cramps. The disease may also affect the\\nintestines, liver, or other parts of the body.\\nDescription\\nAmebiasis, also known as amebic dysentery, is one\\nof the most common parasitic diseases occurring inhumans, with an estimated 500 million new cases eachyear. It occurs most frequently in tropical and subtropicalareas where living conditions are crowded, with inade-quate sanitation. Although most cases of amebiasis occurin persons who carry the disease but do not exhibit anysymptoms (asymptomatic), as many as 100,000 peopledie of amebiasis each year. In the United States, between1 and 5% of the general population will develop amebia-sis in any given year, while male homosexuals, migrantworkers, institutionalized people, and recent immigrantsdevelop amebiasis at a higher rate.\\nHuman beings are the only known host of the amebi-\\nasis organism, and all groups of people, regardless of ageor sex, can become affected. Amebiasis is primarilyspread in food and water that has been contaminated byhuman feces but is also spread by person-to-person con-tact. The number of cases is typically limited, but region-al outbreaks can occur in areas where human feces areused as fertilizer for crops, or in cities with water sup-plies contaminated with human feces.Causes and symptoms\\nRecently, it has been discovered that persons with\\nsymptom-causing amebiasis are infected with Entamoe-\\nba histolytica , and those individuals who exhibit no\\nsymptoms are actually infected with an almost identical-looking ameba called Entamoeba dispar . During their\\nlife cycles, the amebas exist in two very different forms:the infective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot movebut can survive outside the human body because of itsprotective covering, and the disease-producing form, thetrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannotinfect others. The disease is most commonly transmittedwhen a person eats food or drinks water containing E.\\nhistolytica cysts from human feces. In the digestive tract\\nthe cysts are transported to the intestine where the wallsof the cysts are broken open by digestive secretions,releasing the mobile trophozoites. Once released withinthe intestine, the trophozoites multiply by feeding onintestinal bacteria or by invading the lining of the largeintestine. Within the lining of the large intestine, thetrophozoites secrete a substance that destroys intestinaltissue and creates a distinctive bottle-shaped sore (ulcer).The trophozoites may remain inside the intestine, in theintestinal wall, or may break through the intestinal walland be carried by the blood to the liver, lungs, brain, orother organs. Trophozoites that remain in the intestineseventually form new cysts that are carried through thedigestive tract and excreted in the feces. Under favorabletemperature and humidity conditions, the cysts can sur-vive in soil or water for weeks to months, ready to beginthe cycle again.\\nAlthough 90% of cases of amebiasis in the United\\nStates are mild, pregnant women, children under twoyears of age, the elderly, malnourished individuals, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 143Amebiasis\\nA micrograph of Entameoba histolytica, a parasitic amoeba\\nwhich invades and destroys the tissues of the intestines,causing amebiasis and ulceration to the intestinal wall.(Photo Researchers, Inc.

Most persons with\\namebiasis have no noticeable symptoms. Even thoughthese individuals may not feel ill, they are still capable ofinfecting others by person-to-person contact or by conta-minating food or water with cysts that others may ingest,for example, by preparing food with unwashed hands.\\nCHRONIC NON-DYSENTERIC INFECTION. Individu-\\nals may experience symptoms over a long period of timeduring a chronic amebiasis infection and experiencerecurrent episodes of diarrhea that last from one to fourweeks and recur over a period of years. These patientsmay also suffer from abdominal cramps, fatigue , and\\nweight loss.\\nAMEBIC DYSENTERY. In severe cases of intestinal\\namebiasis, the organism invades the lining of the intes-tine, producing sores (ulcers), bloody diarrhea, severeabdominal cramps, vomiting, chills, and fevers as high as104-105°F (40-40.6°C). In addition, a case of acute ame-bic dysentery may cause complications, includinginflammation of the appendix ( appendicitis ), a tear in\\nthe intestinal wall (perforation), or a sudden, severeinflammation of the colon (fulminating colitis).\\nAMEBOMA. An ameboma is a mass of tissue in the\\nbowel that is formed by the amebiasis organism. It canresult from either chronic intestinal infection or acuteamebic dysentery. Amebomas may produce symptomsthat mimic cancer or other intestinal diseases.\\nPERIANAL ULCERS. Intestinal amebiasis may pro-\\nduce skin infections in the area around the patient’s anus(perianal). These ulcerated areas have a “punched-out”appearance and are painful to the touch.\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis\\nExtraintestinal amebiasis accounts for approximate-\\nly 10% of all reported amebiasis cases and includes allforms of the disease that affect other organs.\\nThe most common form of extraintestinal amebiasis\\nis amebic abscess of the liver. In the United States, ame-bic liver abscesses occur most frequently in young His-\\npanic adults. An amebic liver abscess can result fromdirect infection of the liver by E. histolytica or as a com-\\nplication of intestinal amebiasis. Patients with an amebicabscess of the liver complain of pain in the chest or\\nabdomen, fever, nausea, and tenderness on the right sidedirectly above the liver.\\nOther forms of extraintestinal amebiasis, though\\nrare, include infections of the lungs, chest cavity, brain,or genitals. These are extremely serious and have a rela-tively high mortality rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of amebiasis is complicated, partly\\nbecause the disease can affect several areas of the bodyand can range from exhibiting few, if any, symptoms tobeing severe, or even life-threatening. In most cases, aphysician will consider a diagnosis of amebiasis when apatient has a combination of symptoms, in particular,diarrhea and a possible history of recent exposure toamebiasis through travel, contact with infected persons,or anal intercourse.\\nIt is vital to distinguish between amebiasis and\\nanother disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) thatproduces similar symptoms because, if diagnosed incor-rectly, drugs that are given to treat IBD can encourage thegrowth and spread of the amebiasis organism. Because ofthe serious consequences of misdiagnosis, potential casesof IBD must be confirmed with multiple stool samplesand blood tests, and a procedure involving a visualinspection of the intestinal wall using a thin lighted, tubu-lar instrument ( sigmoidoscopy ) to rule out amebiasis.\\nA diagnosis of amebiasis may be confirmed by one\\nor more tests, depending on the location of the disease.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a stool\\nsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of E.\\nhistolytica and not one of the many other intestinal ame-\\nbas that are often found but that do not cause disease. Aseries of three stool tests is approximately 90% accuratein confirming a diagnosis of amebic dysentery. Unfortu-nately, however, the stool test is not useful in diagnosingamebomas or extraintestinal infections.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nSigmoidoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure in\\nwhich a thin, flexible, lighted instrument, called a sig-moidoscope, is used to visually examine the lower part ofthe large intestine for amebic ulcers and take tissue orfluid samples from the intestinal lining.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 144AmebiasisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 144'),\n",

Blood serum will usually test positive for antibodywithin a week of symptom onset. Blood testing, however,cannot always distinguish between a current or past infec-tion since the antibodies may be detectable in the blood foras long as 10 years following initial infection.\\nImaging studies\\nA number of sophisticated imaging techniques, such\\nas computed tomography scans (CT), magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound, can be used to\\ndetermine whether a liver abscess is present. Once locat-ed, a physician may then use a fine needle to withdraw asample of tissue to determine whether the abscess isindeed caused by an amebic infection.\\nTreatment\\nAsymptomatic or mild cases of amebiasis may\\nrequire no treatment. However, because of the potentialfor disease spread, amebiasis is generally treated with amedication to kill the disease-causing amebas. Moresevere cases of amebic dysentery are additionally treatedby replacing lost fluid and blood. Patients with an ame-bic liver abscess will also require hospitalization and bedrest. For those cases of extraintestinal amebiasis, treat-ment can be complicated because different drugs may berequired to eliminate the parasite, based on the locationof the infection within the body. Drugs used to treat ame-biasis, called amebicides, are divided into two categories:\\nLuminal amebicides\\nThese drugs get their name because they act on\\norganisms within the inner cavity (lumen) of the bowel.They include diloxanide furoate, iodoquinol, metronida-zole, and paromomycin.\\nTissue amebicides\\nTissue amebicides are used to treat infections in the\\nliver and other body tissues and include emetine, dehy-droemetine, metronidazole, and chloroquine. Becausethese drugs have potentially serious side effects, patientsgiven emetine or dehydroemetine require bed rest andheart monitoring. Chloroquine has been found to be themost useful drug for treating amebic liver abscess.Patients taking metronidazole must avoid alcoholbecause the drug-alcohol combination causes nausea,vomiting, and headache .KEY TERMS\\nAmeboma —A mass of tissue that can develop on\\nthe wall of the colon in response to amebic infec-tion.\\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nAppendicitis —Condition characterized by the\\nrapid inflammation of the appendix, a part of theintestine.\\nAsymptomatic —Persons who carry a disease and\\nare usually capable of transmitting the disease butwho do not exhibit symptoms of the disease aresaid to be asymptomatic.\\nDysentery —Intestinal infection marked by diar-\\nrhea containing blood and mucus.\\nFulminating colitis —A potentially fatal complica-\\ntion of amebic dysentery marked by sudden andsevere inflammation of the intestinal lining, severebleeding or hemorrhaging, and massive sheddingof dead tissue.\\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) —Disease in\\nwhich the lining of the intestine becomes inflamed.\\nLumen —The inner cavity or canal of a tube-\\nshaped organ, such as the bowel.\\nProtozoan —A single-celled, usually microscopic\\norganism that is eukaryotic and, therefore, differ-ent from bacteria (prokaryotic).\\nMost patients are given a combination of luminal and\\ntissue amebicides over a treatment period of seven to tendays.

Primary amenorrhea is the failure to start having aperiod by the age of 16. Secondary amenorrhea is morecommon and refers to either the temporary or permanentending of periods in a woman who has menstruated nor-mally in the past. Many women miss a period occasional-ly. Amenorrhea occurs if a woman misses three or moreperiods in a row.\\nDescription\\nThe absence of menstrual periods is a symptom, not\\na disease. While the average age that menstruation beginsis 12, the range varies. The incidence of primary amenor-rhea in the United States is just 2.5%.\\nSome female athletes who participate in rowing,\\nlong distance running, and cycling, may notice a fewmissed periods. Women athletes at a particular risk fordeveloping amenorrhea include ballerinas and gymnasts,who typically exercise strenuously and eat poorly.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmenorrhea can have many causes. Primary amenor-\\nrhea can be the result of hormonal imbalances, psychi-atric disorders, eating disorders, malnutrition , excessive\\nthinness or fatness, rapid weight loss, body fat content toolow, and excessive physical conditioning. Intense physicaltraining prior to puberty can delay menarche (the onset\\nof menstruation). Every year of training can delay menar-che for up to five months. Some medications such as anti-depressants, tranquilizers, steroids, and heroin can induceamenorrhea.\\nPrimary amenorrhea\\nHowever, the main cause is a delay in the beginning\\nof puberty either from natural reasons (such as heredity orpoor nutrition ) or because of a problem in the endocrine\\nsystem, such as a pituitary tumor or hypothyroidism . An\\nobstructed flow tract or inflammation in the uterus maybe the presenting indications of an underlying metabolic,endocrine, congenital or gynecological disorder.\\nTypical causes of primary amenorrhea include:\\n• excessive physical activity• drastic weight loss (such as occurs in anorexia or\\nbulimia)\\n• extreme obesity\\n• drugs (antidepressants or tranquilizers)\\n• chronic illness\\n• turner’s syndrome.

In adolescents, pregnancy and\\nstress are two major causes. Missed periods are usually\\ncaused in adolescents by stress and changes in environ-ment. Adolescents are especially prone to irregular peri-ods with fevers, weight loss, changes in environment, orincreased physical or athletic activity. However, any ces-sation of periods for four months should be evaluated.\\nThe most common cause of seconardy amenorrhea is\\npregnancy. Also, a woman’s periods may halt temporarilyafter she stops taking birth control pills. This temporaryhalt usually lasts only for a month or two, though in somecases it can last for a year or more. Secondary amenor-rhea may also be related to hormonal problems related tostress, depression, anorexia nervosa or drugs, or it may\\nbe caused by any condition affecting the ovaries, such as atumor. The cessation of menstruation also occurs perma-nently after menopause or a hysterectomy .\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome is another common cause\\nof secondary amenorrhea. It is caused by ovaries contain-ing many fluid filled sacs (cysts) with abnormal levels ofmale hormones (androgens). This condition is related toimproper functioning of the pituitary gland, as it releaseshormones necessary for pregnancy (leuteinizing hor-mones), and can cause women to develop male characteris-tics, such as acne and coarse body hair. If the condition is\\nnot treated, some of the androgens may convert to estrogen,and chronically high levels of estrogen may increase thechance of developing cancer of the uterine lining.\\nDiagnosis\\nIt may be difficult to find the cause of amenorrhea,\\nbut the exam should start with a pregnancy test; pregnan-cy needs to be ruled out whenever a woman’s period istwo to three weeks overdue. Androgen excess, estrogendeficiency, or other problems with the endocrine systemneed to be checked. Prolactin in the blood and the thy-roid stimulating hormone (TSH) should also be checked.\\nThe diagnosis usually includes a patient history and\\na physical exam (including a pelvic exam ). If a woman\\nhas missed three or more periods in a row, a physicianmay recommend blood tests to measure hormone levels,a scan of the skull to rule out the possibility of a pituitarytumor, and ultrasound scans of the abdomen and pelvis torule out a tumor of the adrenal gland or ovary.Treatment\\nTreatment of amenorrhea depends on the cause. Pri-\\nmary amenorrhea often requires no treatment, but it’salways important to discover the cause of the problem inany case. Not all conditions can be treated, but anyunderlying condition that is treatable should be treated.\\nIf a hormonal imbalance is the problem, proges-\\nterone for one to two weeks every month or two may cor-rect the problem. With polycystic ovary syndrome, birthcontrol pills are often prescribed. A pituitary tumor istreated with bromocriptine, a drug that reduces certainhormone (prolactin) secretions. Weight loss may bringon a period in an obese woman. Easing up on excessiveexercise and eating a proper diet may bring on periods inteen athletes. In very rare cases, surgery may be neededfor women with ovarian or uterine cysts.\\nPrognosis\\nProlonged amenorrhea can lead to infertility and other\\nmedical problems such as osteoporosis (thinning of the\\nbones). If the halt in the normal period is caused by stressor illness, periods should begin again when the stress pass-es or the illness is treated. Amenorrhea that occurs with dis-continuing birth control pills usually go away within six toeight weeks, although it may take up to a year.\\nThe prognosis for polycystic ovary disease depends\\non the severity of the symptoms and the treatment plan.Spironolactone, a drug that blocks the production ofmale hormones, can help in reducing body hair. If awoman wishes to become pregnant, treatment withclomiphene may be required or, on rare occasions,surgery on the ovaries.\\nPrevention\\nPrimary amenorrhea caused by a congenital condi-\\ntion cannot be prevented. In general, however, womenshould maintain a healthy diet, with plenty of exercise,rest, and not too much stress, avoiding smoking and sub-\\nstance abuse. Female athletes should be sure to eat a bal-anced diet and rest and exercise normally.

All of thesedrugs have the same basic chemical structure.\\nPurpose\\nAminoglycosides are primarily used to combat infec-\\ntions due to aerobic, Gram-negative bacteria. These bacte-ria can be identified by their reaction to Gram’s stain. InGram’s staining, a film of material containing the possiblebacteria is placed on a glass slide and dried. The slide isstained with crystal violet for one minute, cleaned off withwater and then placed into a solution of Gram’s iodinesolution for one minute. The iodine solution is rinsed offand the slide is immersed in 95% ethyl alcohol. The slide isthen stained again with reddish carbolfuchsin or safraninefor 30 seconds, rinsed in water, dried and examined. Gram-positive bacteria retain the violet purple stain. Gram-nega-tive bacteria accept the red stain. Bacteria that can success-fully be combated with aminoglycosides includePseudomonas ,Acinetobacter , and Enterobacter species,\\namong others. Aminoglycosides are also effective againstmycobacteria, the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis .\\nThe aminoglycosides can be used against certain\\nGram-positive bacteria, but are not typically employedbecause other antibiotics are more effective and havefewer side effects. Aminoglycosides are ineffectiveagainst anaerobic bacteria (bacteria that cannot grow inthe presence of oxygen), viruses, and fungi. And onlyone aminoglycoside, paromomycin, is used against para-sitic infection.\\nLike all other antibiotics, aminoglycosides are not\\neffective against influenza , the common cold , or other\\nviral infections.\\nPrecautions\\nPre-existing medical conditions—such as kidney dis-\\nease, eighth cranial nerve disease, myasthenia gravis , and\\nParkinson’s disease—should be discussed prior to takingany aminoglycosides. Pregnant women are usually advisedagainst taking aminoglycosides, because their infants maysuffer damage to their hearing, kidneys, or sense of bal-ance. However, those factors need to be considered along-side the threat to the mother’s health and life in cases ofserious infection. Aminoglycosides do not pass into breastmilk to any great extent, so nursing mothers may be pre-scribed aminoglycosides without injuring their infants.\\nDescription\\nStreptomycin, the first aminoglycoside, was isolated\\nfrom Streptomyces griseus in the mid-1940s. This antibiot-ic was very effective against tuberculosis. One of the main\\ndrawbacks to streptomycin is its toxicity, especially to cellsin the inner and middle ear and the kidney. Furthermore,some strains of tuberculosis are resistant to treatment withstreptomycin. Therefore, medical researchers have put con-siderable effort into identifying other antibiotics with strep-tomycin’s efficacy, but without its toxicity.\\nAminoglycosides are absorbed very poorly from the\\ngastrointestinal tract; in fact, aminoglycosides taken oral-ly are excreted virtually unchanged and undiminished inquantity. The route of drug administration depends on thetype and location of the infection being treated. The typi-cal routes of administration are by intramuscular (injec-tion into a muscle) or intravenous injection (injection intoa vein), irrigation, topical skin application, or inhalation.If the infection being treated involves the central nervoussystem, the drug can be injected into the spinal canal.\\nThe bactericidal ability of aminoglycosides has not\\nbeen fully explained. It is known that the drug attaches toa bacterial cell wall and is drawn into the cell via chan-nels made up of the protein, porin. Once inside the cell,the aminoglycoside attaches to the cell’s ribosomes.Ribosomes are the intracellular structures responsible formanufacturing proteins. This attachment either shutsdown protein production or causes the cell to produceabnormal, ineffective proteins. The bacterial cell cannotsurvive with this impediment.\\nAntibiotic treatment using aminoglycosides may\\npair the drug with a second type of antibiotic, usually abeta-lactam or vancomycin, administered separately.Beta-lactams disrupt the integrity of the bacteria cellwall, making it more porous. The increased porosityallows more of the aminoglycoside into the bacteria cell.\\nTraditionally, aminoglycosides were administered at\\neven doses given throughout the day. It was thought thata steady plasma concentration was necessary to combatinfection. However, this administration schedule is timeand labor intensive. Furthermore, administering a singledaily dose can be as effective, or more effective, thanseveral doses throughout the day.\\nDosage depends on the patient’s age, weight, gender,\\nand general health. Since the drug is cleared by the kid-neys, it is important to assess any underlying problemswith kidney function. Kidney function is assessed bymeasuring the blood levels of creatinine, a protein nor-mally found in the body. If these levels are high, it is anindication that the kidneys may not be functioning at anoptimal rate and dosage will be lowered accordingly.\\nRisks\\nAminoglycosides have been shown to be toxic to cer-\\ntain cells in the ears and in the kidneys.

They may even be awarethat they suffer from a memory disorder.\\nPeople who experience amnesia have been instrumen-\\ntal in helping brain researchers determine how the brainprocesses memory. Until the early 1970s, researchersviewed memory as a single entity. Memory of new experi-ences, motor skills, past events, and previous conditioningwere grouped together in one system that relied on a spe-cific area of the brain.\\nIf all memory were stored in the same way, it would\\nbe reasonable to deduce that damage to the specific brainarea would cause complete memory loss. However, stud-ies of amnesiacs counter that theory. Such researchdemonstrates that the brain has multiple systems for pro-cessing, storing, and drawing on memory.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAmnesia has several root causes. Most are traceable\\nto brain injury related to physical trauma, disease, infec-tion, drug and alcohol abuse, or reduced blood flow to\\nthe brain (vascular insufficiency). In Wernicke-Korsakoffsyndrome, for example, damage to the memory centersof the brain results from the use of alcohol or malnutri-\\ntion. Infections that damage brain tissue, including\\nencephalitis and herpes, can also cause amnesia. If the\\namnesia is thought to be of psychological origin, it istermed psychogenic.\\nThere are at least three general types of amnesia:\\n• Anterograde. This form of amnesia follows brain trau-\\nma and is characterized by the inability to remembernew information. Recent experiences and short-termmemory disappear, but victims can recall events priorto the trauma with clarity.\\n• Retrograde. In some ways, this form of amnesia is the\\nopposite of anterograde amnesia: the victim can recallevents that occurred after a trauma, but cannot remem-ber previously familiar information or the events pre-ceding the trauma.\\n• Transient global amnesia. This type of amnesia has no\\nconsistently identifiable cause, but researchers havesuggested that migraines or transient ischemic attacksmay be the trigger. (A transient ischemic attack ,\\nsometimes called “a small stroke,” occurs when ablockage in an artery temporarily blocks off blood sup-ply to part of the brain.) A victim experiences suddenconfusion and forgetfulness. Attacks can be as brief as30-60 minutes or can last up to 24 hours. In severeattacks, a person is completely disoriented and mayexperience retrograde amnesia that extends back sever-al years. While very frightening for the patient, tran-sient global amnesia generally has an excellent progno-sis for recovery.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn diagnosing amnesia and its cause, doctors look at\\nseveral factors. During a physical examination , the doc-\\ntor inquires about recent traumas or illnesses, drug andmedication history, and checks the patient’s generalhealth. Psychological exams may be ordered to deter-mine the extent of amnesia and the memory systemaffected. The doctor may also order imaging tests such asmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reveal whether\\nthe brain has been damaged, and blood work to excludetreatable metabolic causes or chemical imbalances.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the root cause of amnesia and\\nis handled on an individual basis. Regardless of cause,cognitive rehabilitation may be helpful in learning\\nstrategies to cope with memory impairment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 152Amnesia\\nAmygdalaHippocampus\\nMemory loss may result from bilateral damage to the limbic\\nsystem of the brain responsible for memory storage, pro-cessing, and recall.

Depending on the degree of amnesia and its cause,victims may be able to lead relatively normal lives.Amnesiacs can learn through therapy to rely on othermemory systems to compensate for what is lost.\\nPrevention\\nAmnesia is only preventable in so far as brain injury\\ncan be prevented or minimized.

A\\nsample of the amniotic fluid, which surrounds a fetus inthe womb, is collected through a pregnant woman’sabdomen using a needle and syringe. Tests performed onfetal cells found in the sample can reveal the presence ofmany types of genetic disorders, thus allowing doctorsand prospective parents to make important decisionsabout early treatment and intervention.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 153AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 153'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 167}, page_content='Purpose\\nSince the mid-1970s, amniocentesis has been used\\nroutinely to test for Down syndrome , by far the most\\ncommon, nonhereditary, genetic birth defect, afflictingabout one in every 1,000 babies. By 1997, approximately800 different diagnostic tests were available, most ofthem for hereditary genetic disorders such as Tay-Sachs\\ndisease , sickle cell anemia, hemophilia ,muscular dys-\\ntrophy and cystic fibrosis .\\nAmniocentesis, often called amnio, is recommended\\nfor women who will be older than 35 on their due-date. Itis also recommended for women who have already bornechildren with birth defects , or when either of the parents\\nhas a family history of a birth defect for which a diagnos-tic test is available. Another reason for the procedure is toconfirm indications of Down syndrome and certain otherdefects which may have shown up previously during rou-tine maternal blood screening.\\nThe risk of bearing a child with a nonhereditary\\ngenetic defect such as Down syndrome is directly relat-ed to a woman’s age—the older the woman, the greaterthe risk. Thirty-five is the recommended age to beginamnio testing because that is the age at which the risk ofcarrying a fetus with such a defect roughly equals therisk of miscarriage caused by the procedure—about\\none in 200. At age 25, the risk of giving birth to a childwith this type of defect is about one in 1,400; by age 45it increases to about one in 20. Nearly half of all preg-nant women over 35 in the United States undergoamniocentesis and many younger women also decide tohave the procedure. Notably, some 75% of all Downsyndrome infants born in the United States each year areto women younger than 35.\\nOne of the most common reasons for performing\\namniocentesis is an abnormal alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)test. Alpha-fetoprotein is a protein produced by the fetusand present in the mother’s blood. A simple bloodscreening, usually conducted around the 15th week ofpregnancy, can determine the AFP levels in the mother’sblood. Levels that are too high or too low may signalpossible fetal defects. Because this test has a high false-positive rate, another test such as amnio is recommendedwhenever the AFP levels fall outside the normal range.\\nAmniocentesis is generally performed during the\\n16th week of pregnancy, with results usually availablewithin three weeks. It is possible to perform an amnio asearly as the 11th week but this is not usually recommend-ed because there appears to be an increased risk of mis-carriage when done at this time. The advantage of earlyamnio and speedy results lies in the extra time for deci-sion making if a problem is detected. Potential treatmentof the fetus can begin earlier. Important, also, is the factthat elective abortions are safer and less controversial the\\nearlier they are performed.\\nPrecautions\\nAs an invasive surgical procedure, amnio poses a real,\\nalthough small, risk to the health of a fetus. Parents mustweigh the potential value of the knowledge gained, orindeed the reassurance that all is well, against the small riskof damaging what is in all probability a normal fetus. Theserious emotional and ethical dilemmas that adverse testresults can bring must also be considered. The decision toundergo amnio is always a matter of personal choice.\\nDescription\\nThe word amniocentesis literally means “puncture\\nof the amnion,” the thin-walled sac of fluid in which adeveloping fetus is suspended during pregnancy. Duringthe sampling procedure, the obstetrician inserts a veryfine needle through the woman’s abdomen into the uterusand amniotic sac and withdraws approximately oneounce of amniotic fluid for testing. The relatively pain-less procedure is performed on an outpatient basis, some-times using local anesthesia.\\nThe physician uses ultrasound images to guide nee-\\ndle placement and collect the sample, thereby minimiz-ing the risk of fetal injury and the need for repeated nee-dle insertions. Once the sample is collected, the womancan return home after a brief observation period. Shemay be instructed to rest for the first 24 hours and toavoid heavy lifting for two days.\\nThe sample of amniotic fluid is sent to a laboratory\\nwhere fetal cells contained in the fluid are isolated andgrown in order to provide enough genetic material fortesting. This takes about seven to 14 days. The material isthen extracted and treated so that visual examination fordefects can be made. For some disorders, like Tay-Sachs,the simple presence of a telltale chemical compound inthe amniotic fluid is enough to confirm a diagnosis.Depending on the specific tests ordered, and the skill ofthe lab conducting them, all the results are availablebetween one and four weeks after the sample is taken.\\nCost of the procedure depends on the doctor, the lab,\\nand the tests ordered. Most insurers provide coverage forwomen over 35, as a follow-up to positive maternalblood screening results, and when genetic disorders runin the family.\\nAn alternative to amnio, now in general use, is chori-\\nonic villus sampling , or CVS, which can be performed as\\nearly as the eighth week of pregnancy. While this allowsfor the possibility of a first trimester abortion, if warrant-ed, CVS is apparently also riskier and is more expensive.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 154AmniocentesisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 154'),\n",

Patients with blood clotting disorders are also not\\ngood candidates for amputation.\\nDescription\\nAmputations can be either planned or emergency\\nprocedures. Injury and arterial embolisms are the mainreasons for emergency amputations. The operation isperformed under regional or general anesthesia by a gen-eral or orthopedic surgeon in a hospital operating room.\\nDetails of the operation vary slightly depending on\\nwhat part is to be removed. The goal of all amputations istwofold: to remove diseased tissue so that the wound willheal cleanly, and to construct a stump that will allow theattachment of a prosthesis or artificial replacement part.\\nThe surgeon makes an incision around the part to be\\namputated. The part is removed, and the bone is smoothed.A flap is constructed of muscle, connective tissue, andskin to cover the raw end of the bone. The flap is closedover the bone with sutures (surgical stitches) that remainin place for about one month. Often, a rigid dressing or\\ncast is applied that stays in place for about two weeks.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an amputation is performed, extensive testing\\nis done to determine the proper level of amputation.

Enzymes are sub-stances made and used by the body to trigger specificchemical reactions. The primary function of the enzymeamylase is to break down starches in food so that theycan be used by the body. Amylase testing is usually doneto determine the cause of sudden abdominal pain .\\nPurpose\\nAmylase testing is performed to diagnose a number\\nof diseases that elevate amylase levels. Pancreatitis , for\\nexample, is the most common reason for a high amylaselevel. When the pancreas is inflamed, amylase escapesfrom the pancreas into the blood. Within six to 48 hoursafter the pain begins, amylase levels in the blood start torise. Levels will stay high for several days before gradu-ally returning to normal.\\nThere are other causes of increased amylase. An\\nulcer that erodes tissue from the stomach and goes intothe pancreas will cause amylase to spill into the blood.During a mumps infection, amylase from the inflamed\\nsalivary glands increases. Amylase is also found in theliver, fallopian tubes, and small intestine; inflammation ofthese tissues also increases levels. Gall bladder disease,tumors of the lung or ovaries, alcohol poisoning , ruptured\\naortic aneurysm , and intestinal strangulation or perfora-\\ntion can also cause unusually high amylase levels.\\nPrecautions\\nThis is not a screening test for future pancreatic dis-\\nease.\\nDescription\\nAmylase testing is done on both blood and urine.\\nThe laboratory may use any of several testing methodsthat involve mixing the blood or urine sample with a sub-stance with which amylase is known to react. By measur-ing the end-product or the reaction time, technicians cancalculate the amount of amylase present in the sample.More sophisticated methods separately measure the amy-lase made by the pancreas and the amylase made by thesalivary glands.\\nUrine testing is a better long-term monitor of amy-\\nlase levels. The kidneys quickly move extra amylasefrom the blood into the urine. Urine levels rise six to 10hours after blood levels and stay high longer. Urine isusually collected throughout a 2- or 24-hour time period.Results are usually available the same day.\\nPreparation\\nIn most cases, no special preparation is necessary for\\na person undergoing an amylase blood test. Patients takinglonger term urine amylase tests will be given a containerand instructions for collecting the urine at home. The urineshould be refrigerated until it is brought to the laboratory.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site\\nor the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Apply-ing warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results vary based on the laboratory and the\\nmethod used.\\nAbnormal results\\nEight out of ten persons with acute pancreatitis will\\nhave high amylase levels, up to four times the normallevel. Other causes of increased amylase, such asmumps, kidney failure, pregnancy occurring in the\\nabdomen but outside the uterus ( ectopic pregnancy ),\\ncertain tumors, a penetrating ulcer, certain complicationsof diabetes, and advanced pancreatic cancer , are further\\ninvestigated based on the person’s symptoms, medicalhistory, and the results of other tests.\\nIn kidney disease, the kidneys are not as efficient at\\nremoving amylase from the blood. Amylase rises in theblood, but stays at normal levels in the urine.\\nPeople with macroamylasia have large clumps of\\namylase in their blood. These clumps are too large tomove through the kidney, so they stay in the blood. Amy-lase levels in the blood will be high; levels in the urinewill be low.\\nAmylase levels may be low in severe liver disease\\n(including hepatitis), conditions in which the pancreasfails to secrete enough enzyme for proper digestions(pancreatic insufficiency), when toxic materials build upin the blood during pregnancy (pre-eclampsia), followingburns , in thyroid disorders, and in advanced cystic\\nfibrosis .

Amyloidosis, which occurs when accu-mulated amyloid deposits impair normal body function,can cause organ failure or death . It is a rare disease,\\noccurring in about eight of every 1,000,000 people. Itaffects males and females equally and usually developsafter the age of 40. At least 15 types of amyloidosis havebeen identified. Each one is associated with deposits of adifferent kind of protein.\\nTypes of amyloidosis\\nThe major forms of this disease are primary sys-\\ntemic, secondary, and familial or hereditary amyloidosis.There is also another form of amyloidosis associatedwith Alzheimer’s disease .\\nPrimary systemic amyloidosis usually develops\\nbetween the ages of 50 and 60.

Also known as light-chain-related amyloidosis, itmay also occur in association with multiple myeloma\\n(bone marrow cancer ).\\nSecondary amyloidosis is a result of chronic infec-\\ntion or inflammatory disease. It is often associated with:\\n•familial Mediterranean fever (a bacterial infection\\ncharacterized by chills, weakness, headache , and\\nrecurring fever )\\n• granulomatous ileitis (inflammation of the small intes-\\ntine)\\n• Hodgkin’s disease (cancer of the lymphatic system)• leprosy• osteomyelitits (bacterial infection of bone and bone\\nmarrow)\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\nFamilial or hereditary amyloidosis is the only inher-\\nited form of the disease. It occurs in members of mostethnic groups, and each family has a distinctive patternof symptoms and organ involvement. Hereditary amyloi-dosis is though to be autosomal dominant, which meansthat only one copy of the defective gene is necessary tocause the disease. A child of a parent with familial amy-loidosis has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.\\nAmyloidosis can involve any organ or system in the\\nbody. The heart, kidneys, gastrointestinal system, andnervous system are affected most often. Other commonsites of amyloid accumulation include the brain, joints,liver, spleen, pancreas, respiratory system, and skin.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of amyloidosis is unknown. Most patients\\nhave gastrointestinal abnormalities, but other symptomsvary according to the organ(s) or system(s) affected bythe disease. Usually the affected organs are rubbery, firm,and enlarged.\\nHeart\\nBecause amyloid protein deposits can limit the\\nheart’s ability to fill with blood between beats, even theslightest exertion can cause shortness of breath . If the\\nheart’s electrical system is affected, the heart’s rhythmmay become erratic. The heart may also be enlarged andheart murmurs may be present.

It is also known asmotor neuron disease and Lou Gehrig’s disease, after thebaseball player whose career it ended.\\nDescription\\nALS is a disease of the motor neurons, those nerve\\ncells reaching from the brain to the spinal cord (uppermotor neurons) and the spinal cord to the peripheralnerves (lower motor neurons) that control muscle move-ment. In ALS, for unknown reasons, these neurons die,leading to a progressive loss of the ability to move virtual-ly any of the muscles in the body. ALS affects “volun-tary” muscles, those controlled by conscious thought,such as the arm, leg, and trunk muscles. ALS, in and ofitself, does not affect sensation, thought processes, theheart muscle, or the “smooth” muscle of the digestive sys-tem, bladder, and other internal organs. Most people withALS retain function of their eye muscles as well. Howev-er, various forms of ALS may be associated with a loss ofintellectual function ( dementia ) or sensory symptoms.\\n“Amyotrophic” refers to the loss of muscle bulk, a\\ncardinal sign of ALS. “Lateral” indicates one of theregions of the spinal cord affected, and “sclerosis”describes the hardened tissue that develops in place ofhealthy nerves. ALS affects approximately 30,000 peoplein the United States, with about 5,000 new cases eachyear. It usually begins between the ages of 40 and 70,although younger onset is possible. Men are slightlymore likely to develop ALS than women.\\nALS progresses rapidly in most cases. It is fatal\\nwithin three years for 50% of all people affected, andwithin five years for 80%. Ten percent of people withALS live beyond eight years.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe symptoms of ALS are caused by the death of\\nmotor neurons in the spinal cord and brain. Normally, theseneurons convey electrical messages from the brain to themuscles to stimulate movement in the arms, legs, trunk,neck, and head. As motor neurons die, the muscles theyenervate cannot be moved as effectively, and weaknessresults. In addition, lack of stimulation leads to musclewasting, or loss of bulk. Involvement of the upper motorneurons causes spasms and increased tone in the limbs, andabnormal reflexes. Involvement of the lower motor neuronscauses muscle wasting and twitching (fasciculations).\\nAlthough many causes of motor neuron degenera-\\ntion have been suggested for ALS, none has yet beenproven responsible. Results of recent research haveimplicated toxic molecular fragments known as free radi-cals. Some evidence suggests that a cascade of eventsleads to excess free radical production inside motor neu-rons, leading to their death. Why free radicals should beproduced in excess amounts is unclear, as is whether thisexcess is the cause or the effect of other degenerativeprocesses. Additional agents within this toxic cascademay include excessive levels of a neurotransmitterknown as glutamate, which may over-stimulate motorneurons, thereby increasing free-radical production, anda faulty detoxification enzyme known as SOD-1, for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 163Amyotrophic lateral sclerosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 163'),\n",

The actual pathway of\\ndestruction is not known, however, nor is the trigger forthe rapid degeneration that marks ALS. Further researchmay show that other pathways are involved, perhaps oneseven more important than this one. Autoimmune factorsor premature aging may play some role, as could viral\\nagents or environmental toxins.\\nTwo major forms of ALS are known: familial and\\nsporadic. Familial ALS accounts for about 10% of all ALScases. As the name suggests, familial ALS is believed to becaused by the inheritance of one or more faulty genes.About 15% of families with this type of ALS have muta-tions in the gene for SOD-1. SOD-1 gene defects are dom-inant, meaning only one gene copy is needed to developthe disease. Therefore, a parent with the faulty gene has a50% chance of passing the gene along to a child.Sporadic ALS has no known cause. While many\\nenvironmental toxins have been suggested as causes, todate no research has confirmed any of the candidatesinvestigated, including aluminum and mercury and leadfrom dental fillings. As research progresses, it is likelythat many cases of sporadic ALS will be shown to have agenetic basis as well.\\nA third type, called Western Pacific ALS, occurs in\\nGuam and other Pacific islands.

Leg weaknessmay first become apparent by an increased frequency ofstumbling on uneven pavement, or an unexplained diffi-culty climbing stairs. Arm weakness may lead to difficul-ty grasping and holding a cup, for instance, or loss ofdexterity in the fingers.\\nLess often, the earliest sign of ALS is weakness in\\nthe bulbar muscles, those muscles in the mouth and\\nthroat that control chewing, swallowing, and speaking. Aperson with bulbar weakness may become hoarse or tiredafter speaking at length, or speech may become slurred.\\nIn addition to weakness, the other cardinal signs of\\nALS are muscle wasting and persistent twitching (fascic-ulation). These are usually seen after weakness becomesobvious. Fasciculation is quite common in people withoutthe disease, and is virtually never the first sign of ALS.\\nWhile initial weakness may be limited to one region,\\nALS almost always progresses rapidly to involve virtuallyall the voluntary muscle groups in the body. Later symp-toms include loss of the ability to walk, to use the arms andhands, to speak clearly or at all, to swallow, and to hold thehead up. Weakness of the respiratory muscles makesbreathing and coughing difficult, and poor swallowing con-trol increases the likelihood of inhaling food or saliva (aspi-ration). Aspiration increases the likelihood of lung infec-tion, which is often the cause of death. With a ventilatorand scrupulous bronchial hygiene, a person with ALS maylive much longer than the average, although weakness andwasting will continue to erode any remaining functionalabilities. Most people with ALS continue to retain functionof the extraocular muscles that move their eyes, allowingsome communication to take place with simple blinks orthrough use of a computer-assisted device.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of ALS begins with a complete med-\\nical history and physical exam, plus a neurological exam-ination to determine the distribution and extent of weak-ness. An electrical test of muscle function, called an elec-tromyogram, or EMG, is an important part of the diag-nostic process. Various other tests, including blood andurine tests, x rays, and CT scans, may be done to rule outother possible causes of the symptoms, such as tumors ofthe skull base or high cervical spinal cord, thyroid dis-ease, spinal arthritis, lead poisoning , or severe vitamin\\ndeficiency. ALS is rarely misdiagnosed following a care-ful review of all these factors.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for ALS, and no treatment that can\\nsignificantly alter its course.

Riluzole (Rilutek) appears to pro-vide on average a three-month increase in life expectancywhen taken regularly early in the disease, and shows asignificant slowing of the loss of muscle strength. Rilu-zole acts by decreasing glutamate release from nerve ter-minals. Experimental trials of nerve growth factor havenot demonstrated any benefit.

Modern mechanical ventilators aresmall and portable, allowing a person with ALS to main-tain the maximum level of function and mobility. Ventila-tion may be administered through a mouth or nose piece,or through a tracheostomy tube. This tube is insertedthrough a small hole made in the windpipe. In addition toproviding direct access to the airway, the tube alsodecreases the risk aspiration.

Thiscare is often provided by a spouse or other family mem-ber. While the skills involved are not difficult to learn,the physical and emotional burden of care can be over-whelming. Caregivers need to recognize and provide fortheir own needs as well as those of people with ALS, toprevent depression, burnout, and bitterness.\\nThroughout the disease, a support group can provide\\nimportant psychological aid to affected persons and theircaregivers as they come to terms with the losses ALSinflicts. Support groups are sponsored by both the ALSSociety and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGiven the grave prognosis and absence of tradition-\\nal medical treatments, it is not surprising that a largenumber of alternative treatments have been tried forALS. Two studies published in 1988 suggested thatamino-acid therapies may provide some improvementfor some people with ALS. While individual reportsclaim benefits for megavitamin therapy, herbal medi-cine, and removal of dental fillings, for instance, no evi-dence suggests that these offer any more than a briefpsychological boost, often followed by a more severeletdown when it becomes apparent the disease has con-tinued unabated. However, once the causes of ALS arebetter understood, alternative therapies may be moreintensively studied. For example, if damage by free radi-cals turns out to be the root of most of the symptoms,antioxidant vitamins and supplements may be used\\nmore routinely to slow the progression of ALS. Or, ifenvironmental toxins are implicated, alternative thera-pies with the goal of detoxifying the body may be ofsome use.Prognosis\\nALS usually progresses rapidly, and leads to death\\nfrom respiratory infection within three to five years inmost cases. The slowest disease progression is seen inthose who are young and have their first symptoms in thelimbs. About 10% of people with ALS live longer thaneight years.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent ALS or to alter its\\ncourse.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAdams, Raymond D, Victor, Maurice and Ropper, Allan H.\\nAdam’s & Victor’s Principles of Neurology, 6th ed.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, DrPH\\nAnaerobic infections\\nDefinition\\nAn anaerobic infection is an infection caused by\\nbacteria (called anaerobes) which cannot grow in thepresence of oxygen. Anaerobic bacteria can infect deepwounds , deep tissues, and internal organs where there is\\nlittle oxygen. These infections are characterized byabscess formation, foul-smelling pus, and tissue\\ndestruction.\\nDescription\\nAnaerobic means “life without air.” Anaerobic bac-\\nteria grow in places which completely, or almost com-pletely, lack oxygen. They are normally found in themouth, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina, and on the skin.Commonly known diseases caused by anaerobic bacteriainclude gas gangrene ,tetanus , and botulism . Nearly all\\ndental infections are caused by anaerobic bacteria.Anaerobic bacteria can cause an infection when a\\nnormal barrier (such as skin, gums, or intestinal wall)is damaged due to surgery, injury, or disease. Usually,the immune system kills any invading bacteria, butsometimes the bacteria are able to grow and cause aninfection. Body sites that have tissue destruction(necrosis) or a poor blood supply are low in oxygenand favor the growth of anaerobic bacteria. The lowoxygen condition can result from blood vessel disease,shock , injury, and surgery.\\nAnaerobic bacteria can cause infection practically\\nanywhere in the body. For example:\\n• Mouth, head, and neck. Infections can occur in the root\\ncanals, gums (gingivitis), jaw, tonsils, throat, sinuses,and ears.\\n• Lung. Anaerobic bacteria can cause pneumonia , lung\\nabscesses, infecton of the lining of the lung ( empye-\\nma), and dilated lung bronchi ( bronchiectasis ).\\n• Intraabdominal. Anaerobic infections within the\\nabdomen include abscess formation, peritonitis , and\\nappendicitis .\\n• Female genital tract. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\npelvic abscesses, pelvic inflammatory disease ,\\ninflammation of the uterine lining (endometritis), andpelvic infections following abortion, childbirth , and\\nsurgery.\\n• Skin and soft tissue. Anaerobic bacteria are common\\ncauses of diabetic skin ulcers, gangrene, destructiveinfection of the deep skin and tissues (necrotizing fasci-tis), and bite wound infections.\\n• Central nervous system. Anaerobic bacteria can cause\\nbrain and spinal cord abscesses.\\n• Bloodstream. Anaerobic bacteria can be found in the\\nbloodstream of ill patients (a condition called bac-teremia).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nPeople who have experienced shock, injury, or\\nsurgery, and those with blood vessel disease or tumorsare at an increased risk for infection by anaerobic bacte-ria. There are many different kinds of anaerobic bacteriawhich can cause an infection. Indeed, most anaerobicinfections are “mixed infections” which means thatthere is a mixture of different bacteria growing. Theanaerobic bacteria that most frequently cause infectionsare Bacteroides fragilis ,Peptostreptococcus , and\\nClostridium species.\\nThe signs and symptoms of anaerobic infection\\ncan vary depending on the location of the infection. Ingeneral, anaerobic infections result in tissue destruc-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 167Anaerobic infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 167'),\n",

Symptoms for specific infections are\\nas follows:\\n• Tooth and gum infections. Swollen, tender bleeding\\ngums, bad breath , and pain . Severe infections may\\nproduce oozing sores.\\n• Throat infection. An extremely sore throat , bad breath,\\na bad taste in the mouth, fever, and a sense of choking .\\n• Lung infection. Chest pain, coughing, difficulty breath-\\ning, fever, foul-smelling sputum, and weight loss.\\n• Intraabdominal infection. Pain, fever, and possibly, if fol-\\nlowing surgery, foul- smelling drainage from the wound.\\n• Pelvic infection. Foul-smelling pus or blood draining\\nfrom the uterus, general or localized pelvic pain, fever,and chills.\\n• Skin and soft tissue infection. Infected wounds are red,\\npainful, swollen, and may drain a foul-smelling pus.Skin infection causes localized swelling, pain, redness,and possibly a painful, open sore (ulcer) which drainsfoul-smelling pus. Severe skin infections may causeextensive tissue destruction (necrosis).\\n• Bloodstream. Bloodstream invasion causes high fever\\n(up to 105°F [40.6°C]), chills, a general ill feeling, andis potentially fatal.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anaerobic infection is based pri-\\nmarily on symptoms, the patient’s medical history, andlocation of the infection. A foul-smelling infection ordrainage from an abscess is diagnostic of anaerobicinfection. This foul smell is produced by anaerobic bac-teria and occurs in one third to one half of patients late inthe infection. Other clues to anaerobic infection includetissue necrosis and gas production at the infection site. Asample from the infected site may be obtained, using aswab or a needle and syringe, to determine which bacte-ria is (are) causing the infection. Because these bacteriacan be easily killed by oxygen, they rarely grow in thelaboratory cultures of tissue or pus samples.KEY TERMS\\nAbscess —A lump filled with pus resulting from an\\ninfection.\\nAnaerobic —Living and growing in the absence of\\noxygen.\\nNecrosis —Tissue death and destruction resulting\\nfrom infection or disease.The recent medical history of the patient is helpful\\nin diagnosing anaerobic infection. A patient who has orrecently had surgery, dental work, tumors, blood vesseldisease, or injury are susceptible to this infection. Thefailure to improve following treatment with antibiotics\\nthat aren’t able to kill anaerobes is another clue that theinfection is caused by anaerobes. The location and typeof infection also help in the diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic tests may include blood tests to see if\\nbacteria are in the bloodstream and x rays to look atinternal infections.\\nTreatment\\nSerious infections may require hospitalization for\\ntreatment. Immediate antibiotic treatment of anaerobicinfections is necessary. Laboratory testing may identifythe bacteria causing the infection and also which antibi-otic will work best. Every antibiotic does not workagainst all anaerobic bacteria but nearly all anaerobes arekilled by chloramphenicol (Chloromycetin), metronida-zole (Flagyl or Protostat), and imipenem (Primaxin).Other antibiotics which may be used are clindamycin(Cleocin) or cefoxitin (Mefoxin).\\nSurgical removal or drainage of the abscess is\\nalmost always required. This may involve drainage byneedle and syringe to remove the pus from a skin abscess(called “aspiration”). The area would be numbed prior tothe aspiration procedure. Also, some internal abscessescan be drained using this procedure with the help ofultrasound (a device which uses sound waves to visualizeinternal organs). This type of abscess drainage may beperformed in the doctor’s office.\\nPrognosis\\nComplete recovery should be achieved with the\\nappropriate surgery and antibiotic treatment. Untreatedor uncontrolled infections can cause severe tissue andbone destruction, which would require plastic surgery torepair. Serious infections can be life threatening.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough anaerobic infections can occur in anyone,\\ngood hygiene and general health may help to preventinfections.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

In boys\\nwith high anal atresia, there may be a channel (fistula)connecting the large intestine to either the urethra (whichdelivers urine from the bladder) or the bladder itself. Ingirls, the channel may connect with the vagina. Sixtypercent of children with high anal atresia have otherdefects, including problems with the esophagus, urinarytract, and bones. In low anal atresia, the channel mayopen in front of the circular mass of muscles that con-strict to close the anal opening (anal sphincter) or, inboys, below the scrotum. Occasionally, the intestine endsjust under the skin. It is estimated that overall abnormali-ties of the anus and rectum occur in about one in every5,000 births and are slightly more common among boys.A mother who has one child with these kind of condi-tions has a 1% chance of having another child who suf-fers from this ailment.\\nCause and symptoms\\nAnal atresia is a defect in the development of the\\nfetus. The cause is unknown, but genetics seem to play aminor role.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsually a physician can make an obvious visual\\ndiagnosis of anal atesia right after birth. Occasionally,however, anal atresia is missed until the baby is fed andsigns of intestinal obstruction appear. At the end of thefirst or second day, the abdomen swells and there is vom-iting of fecal material. To determine the type of anal atre-sia and the exact position, x rays will be taken whichinclude injecting opaque dye into the opening. Magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography\\nscans (CT), as well as ultrasound, are the imaging tech-\\nniques used to determine the type and size of the analatresia. Ultrasound uses sound waves, CT scans pass xrays through the body at different angles, and an MRIuses a magnetic field and radio waves.KEY TERMS\\nAnus —The canal at the end of the large intestine\\nthrough which waste is excreted to the outside ofthe body.\\nBowel obstruction —Anything that prevents waste\\nfrom moving normally to the anal opening.\\nColostomy —An operation where the large intes-\\ntine is diverted through an opening in theabdomen and waste is excreted.\\nFeces —Bodily waste material that normally passes\\nthrough the anus.\\nFistula —An abnormal channel that connects two\\norgans or connects an organ to the skin.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment for anal atresia. For\\nhigh anal atresia, immediately after the diagnosis is made,a surgical incision is made in the large intestine to make atemporary opening ( colostomy ) in the abdomen where\\nwaste is excreted. Several months later, the intestine ismoved into the ring of muscle (sphincter) that is part ofthe anus and a hole is made in the skin. The colostomy isclosed several weeks later. In low anal atresia, immediate-ly after diagnosis, a hole is made in the skin to open thearea where the anus should be. If the channel is in thewrong place, the intestine is moved into the correct posi-tion sometime during the child’s first year. After surgery,the pediatric surgeon uses an instrument to dilate orwiden the rectum and teaches the parents how to do thisdaily at home to prevent scar tissue from contracting.\\nPrognosis\\nWith high anal atresia, many children have problems\\ncontrolling bowel function. Most also become constipat-ed. With low anal atresia, children generally have goodbowel control, but they may still become constipated.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent anal atresia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFreeman, Neill V . “Anorectal Malformations.” In Surgery of the\\nNewborn.

The anus is the inch-and-a-half-long endportion of the large intestine, which opens to allow solidwastes to exit the body. Other parts of the large intestineinclude the colon and the rectum.\\nDescription\\nDifferent cancers can develop in different parts of\\nthe anus, part of which is inside the body and part ofwhich is outside. Sometimes abnormal changes of theanus are harmless in their early stages but may laterdevelop into cancer. Some anal warts , for example, con-\\ntain precancerous areas and can develop into cancer.Types of anal cancer include:\\n• Squamous Cell Carcinomas. Approximately half of\\nanal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas, which arisefrom the cells lining the anal margin and the anal canal.The anal margin is the part of the anus that is half insideand half outside the body, and the anal canal is the partof the anus that is inside the body. The earliest form ofsquamous cell carcinoma is known as carcinoma insitu, or Bowen’s disease.\\n• Cloacogenic Carcinomas. Approximately one-fourth to\\none-third of anal tumors are cloacogenic carcinomas.These tumors develop in the transitional zone, or cloa-ca, which is a ring of tissue between the anal canal andthe rectum.\\n• Adenocarcinomas. About 15% of anal cancers are ade-\\nnocarcinomas, which affect glands in the anal area. Onetype of adenocarcinoma that can occur in the anal areais called Paget’s disease, which can also affect thevulva, breasts, and other areas of the body.\\n• Skin cancers. A small percentage of anal cancers are\\neither basal cell carcinomas, or malignant melanomas,two types of skin cancer. Malignant melanomas, whichdevelop from skin cells that produce the brown pigmentcalled melanin, are far more common on areas of thebody exposed to the sun.\\nApproximately 3,500 Americans will be diagnosed\\nwith anal cancer in 2001, and an estimated 500 individu-als will die of the disease during this same interval,according to the American Cancer Society. Anal cancersare fairly rare: they make up only 1% to 2% of cancersaffecting the digestive system. The disease affectswomen somewhat more often than men, although thenumber of cases among men, particularly homosexualmen, seems to be increasing.Causes and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of most anal cancers is unknown,\\nalthough certain individuals appear to have a higher riskof developing the disease. Smokers are at higher risk, asare individuals with certain types of the human papillo-mavirus (HPV), and those with long-term problems inthe anal area, such as abnormal openings known as fistu-las. Since it increases the risk of HPV infection, the prac-tice of anal sex appears to increase the risk of analcancer—male homosexuals who practice anal sex areabout 33 times more likely to have anal cancers than het-erosexual men. Those with weakened immune systems,such individuals with HIV, or transplant patients takingimmunosuppressant drugs , are also at higher risk.\\nMost individuals with anal cancer are over the age of 50.\\nSymptoms of anal cancer resemble those found in\\nother harmless conditions. They include pain ,itching\\nand bleeding, straining during a bowel movement,change in bowel habits, change in the diameter of thestool, discharge from the anus, and swollen lymph nodesin the anal or groin area.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnal cancer is sometimes diagnosed during routine\\nphysicals, or during minor procedures such as hemorrhoidremoval. It may also be diagnosed during a digital rectal\\nexamination (DRE), when a physician inserts a gloved,\\nlubricated finger into the anus to feel for unusual growths.Individuals over the age of 50 who have no symptomsshould have a digital rectal examination (DRE) every  fiveto 10 years, according to American Cancer Society (ACS)guidelines for early detection of colorectal cancer.\\nOther diagnostic procedures for anal cancer include:\\nAnoscopy . A procedure that involves use of a special\\ndevice to examine the anus. Proctoscopy. A procedure thatinvolves use of a lighted scope to see the anal canal. Tran-srectal ultrasound. A procedure in which sound waves areused to create an image of the anus and nearby tissues.\\nA biopsy is performed on any suspicious growths;\\nthat is, a tiny piece of the growth is examined under amicroscope for cancer cells. The physician may also per-form a procedure called a fine needle aspiration biopsy,in which a needle is used to withdraw fluid from lymphnodes located near the growth, to make sure the cancerhasn’t spread to these nodes.\\nAnal cancer severity is categorized by the following\\nstages:\\n• Stage 0 anal cancer is found only in the top layer of\\nanal tissue.\\n• Stage I anal cancer has spread beyond the top layer of\\nanal tissue, but is less than 1 inch in diameter.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 170Anal cancerGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 170'),\n",

A local\\nresection, performed if the cancer has not spread,removes the tumor and an area of tissue around the tumor.An abdominoperineal resection is a more complex proce-dure in which the anus and the lower rectum are removed,and an opening called a colostomy is created for body\\nwastes to exit. This procedure is fairly uncommon todaybecause radiation and chemotherapy are just as effective.\\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy rays to fight\\ncancer cells. It is usually delivered via a machine outsidethe body, but may also be delivered via surgicallyimplanted radioactive pellets. This latter method is calledinternal radiation, brachytherapy, or interstitial radiation.Side effects of radiation may include tiredness, skin dam-age resembling sunburn , and damage to anal tissues.\\nChemotherapy fights cancer using drugs, which may\\nbe delivered via pill or needle. Some chemotherapy typeskill cancer cells directly, while others act indirectly bymaking cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation. Themain drugs used to treat anal cancer are 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and mitomycin or 5-FU and cisplatin. Side effects ofchemotherapy, which damages normal cells in addition tocancer cells, may include nausea and vomiting , hair\\nloss, loss of appetite, diarrhea , mouth sores, fatigue ,\\nshortness of breath , and a weakened immune system.\\nAlternative treatment\\nResearch suggests acupuncture can help manage\\nchemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting and controlpain associated with surgery.\\nPrognosis\\nAnal cancer is often curable.

They can be yellow, pink, or lightbrown in color, and only rarely are painful or uncomfort-able. In fact, infected individuals often are unaware thatthey exist. Most cases are caused by sexual transmission.\\nMost individuals have between one to 10 genital\\nwarts thtat range in size from roughly 0.5–1.9 cm\\n2. Some\\nwill complain of painless bumps or itching , but often,\\nthese warts can remain completely unnoticed.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCondyloma acuminatum is one of the most common\\nsexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States.Young adults aged 17 to 33 years are at greatest risk.Risk factors include smoking , using oral contracep-\\ntives , having multiple sexual partners, and an early coital\\nage. In addition, individuals who have a history ofimmunosuppression or anal intercourse are also at risk.\\nRoughly 90% of all anal warts are caused by the\\nhuman papilloma virus (HPV) types 6 and 11, which arethe least likely of over 60 types of HPV to become can-cerous. Anal warts are usually transmitted through directsexual contact with someone who is infected with condy-loma acuminata anywhere in the genital area, includingthe penis and vagina. Studies have shown that roughly75% of those who engage in sexual contact with some-one infected with condyloma acuminata will developthese warts within three months.\\nTreatment\\nAccording to guidelines from the Centers for Dis-\\nease Control (CDC), the treatment of all genital warts,including anal warts, should be conducted according tothe methods preferred by the patient, the medications orprocedures most readily available, and the experience ofthe patient’s physician in removing anal warts.\\nTreatment options include electrical cautery, surgi-\\ncal removal, or both. Warts that appear inside the analcanal will almost always be treated with cauterization orsurgical removal. Surgical removal, also known as exci-sion, has the highest success rates and lowest recurrencerates. Indeed, studies have shown that initial cure ratesrange from 63–91%.\\nUnfortunately, most cases require numerous treat-\\nments because the virus that causes the warts can live inthe surrounding tissue. The area may seem normal andwart-free for six months or longer before another wartdevelops.\\nLaser surgery is another possibility, but requires\\nlocal, general, or spinal anesthesia, depending on thenumber warts and where they are.\\nElectrocoagulation, a technique that uses electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts, is usually the most painful ofthe procedures done to eliminate condyloma acuminataof the anus, and is usually reserved for larger warts. It isdone with local anesthesia, and may cause discharge orbleeding from the anus.\\nFollow-up visits to the physician are necessary to\\nmake sure that the warts have not recurred. It is recom-mended that these patients see their physicians everythree to six months for up to 1.5 years, which is how longthe incubation period is for the HPV virus.\\nCarbon dioxide laser treatment and electrodesicca-\\ntion are other options, but these are usually reserved forextensive warts or those that continue to recur despitenumerous treatments. However, because HPV virus canbe transmitted via the smoke caused by these procedures,they are usually reserved for the worst infections.\\nFor small warts that affect only the skin around the\\nanus, several medications are available, which can beapplied directly to the surface of the warts by a physicianor by the patients themselves.\\nSuch medications include podophyllum resin\\n(Podocon-25, Pod-Ben-25), a substance made from thecytotoxic extracts of several plants.

Unfortunately, many cases of anal wartseither fail to respond to treatment or recur. Patients haveto undergo roughly six to nine treatments over severalmonths to assure that the warts are completely eradicated.\\nRecurrence rates have been estimated to be over 50%\\nafter one year and may be due to the long incubation ofHPV (up to 1.5 years), deep lesions, undetected lesions,virus present in surrounding skin that is not treated.\\nPrevention\\nSexual abstinence and monogamous relationships can\\nbe the most effective form of prevention, and condomsmay also decrease the chances of transmission of condylo-ma acuminata. Abstinence from sexual relations with peo-ple who have anal or genital warts can prevent infection.Unfortunately, since many people may not be aware thatthey have this condition, this is not always possible.KEY TERMS\\nElectrocoagulation —a technique using electrical\\nenergy to destroy the warts. Usually done for wartswithin the anus with a local anesthesia, electroco-agulation is most painful form of therapy, and cancause both bleeding and discharge from the anus.\\nIndividuals infected with anal warts should have fol-\\nlow-up checkups every few weeks after their initial treat-ment, after which self-exams can be done.\\nSexual partners of people who have anal warts\\nshould also be examined, as a precautionary preventivemeasure.\\nFinally, 5-flourouracil (Adrucil, Efudex, Fluoroplex)\\nmay be useful to prevent recurrence once the warts havebeen removed.

Other drugs, notably the tricyclic anti-\\ndepressants and anti-epileptic agents such as gabapentin,have been used to relieve pain, particularly neurologicpain, but are not routinely classified as analgesics. Anal-gesics provide symptomatic relief, but have no effect oncausation, although clearly the NSAIDs, by virtue oftheir dual activity, may be beneficial in both regards.\\nDescription\\nPain has been classified as “productive” pain and\\n“non-productive” pain. While this distinction has nophysiologic meaning, it may serve as a guide to treat-ment. “Productive” pain has been described as a warningof injury, and so may be both an indication of need fortreatment and a guide to diagnosis. “Non-productive”pain by definition serves no purpose either as a warningor diagnostic tool.\\nAlthough pain syndromes may be dissimilar, the\\ncommon factor is a sensory pathway from the affectedorgan to the brain. Analgesics work at the level of thenerves, either by blocking the signal from the peripheralnervous system, or by distorting the interpretation by thecentral nervous system. Selection of an appropriate anal-gesic is based on consideration of the risk-benefit factorsof each class of drugs, based on type of pain, severity ofpain, and risk of adverse effects. Traditionally, pain hasbeen divided into two classes, acute and chronic,although severity and projected patient survival are otherfactors that must be considered in drug selection.\\nAcute pain\\nAcute pain is self limiting in duration, and includes\\npost-operative pain, pain of injury, and childbirth .\\nBecause pain of these types is expected to be short term,the long-term side effects of analgesic therapy may rou-tinely be ignored. Thus, these patients may safely betreated with narcotic analgesics without concern for theiraddictive potential, or NSAIDs with only limited concernfor their ulcerogenic risks. Drugs and doses should beadjusted based on observation of healing rate, switchingpatients from high to low doses, and from narcotic anal-gesics to non-narcotics when circumstances permit.\\nAn important consideration of pain management in\\nsevere pain is that patients should not be subject to thereturn of pain. Analgesics should be dosed adequately toassure that the pain is at least tolerable, and frequentlyenough to avoid the anxiety that accompanies the antici-\\npated return of pain. Analgesics should never be dosed ona “prn” (as needed) basis, but should be administered oftenenough to assure constant blood levels of analgesic. This\\napplies to both the narcotic and non-narcotic analgesics.\\nChronic pain\\nChronic pain, pain lasting over three months and\\nsevere enough to impair function, is more difficult totreat, since the anticipated side effects of the analgesicsare more difficult to manage. In the case of narcotic anal-gesics this means the addiction potential, as well as res-\\npiratory depression and constipation . For the NSAIDs,\\nthe risk of gastric ulcers may be dose limiting. Whilesome classes of drugs, such as the narcotic agonist/antag-onist drugs bupronophine, nalbuphine and pentazocine,and the selective COX-2 inhibitors celecoxib and rofe-coxib represent advances in reduction of adverse effects,they are still not fully suitable for long-term managementof severe pain. Generally, chronic pain managementrequires a combination of drug therapy, life-style modifi-cation, and other treatment modalities.\\nNarcotic analgesics\\nThe narcotic analgesics, also termed opioids, are all\\nderived from opium. The class includes morphine,codeine, and a number of semi-synthetics includingmeperidine (Demerol), propoxyphen (Darvon) and oth-ers. The narcotic analgesics vary in potency, but all areeffective in treatment of visceral pain when used in ade-quate doses. Adverse effects are dose related. Becausethese drugs are all addictive, they are controlled underfederal and state laws. A variety of dosage forms areavailable, including oral solids, liquids, intravenous andintrathecal injections, and transcutaneous patches.\\nNSAIDs, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are\\neffective analgesics even at doses too low to have anyanti-inflammatory effects. There are a number of chemi-cal classes, but all have similar therapeutic effects andside effects. Most are appropriate only for oral adminis-tration; however ketorolac (Toradol) is appropriate forinjection and may be used in moderate to severe pain forshort periods.\\nAcetaminophen is a non-narcotic analgesic with no\\nanti-inflammatory properties. It is appropriate for mild tomoderate pain. Although the drug is well tolerated in nor-mal doses, it may have significant toxicity at high doses.Because acetaminophen is largely free of side effects attherapeutic doses, it has been considered the first choicefor mild pain, including that of osteoarthritis .\\nRecommended dosage\\nAppropriate dosage varies by drug, and should con-\\nsider the type of pain, as well as other risks associated\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 174AnalgesicsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 174'),\n",

Similarly, because narcotics\\nare more rapidly metabolized in patients who have usedthese drugs for a long period, higher than normal dosesmay be needed to provide adequate pain management.NSAIDs, although comparatively safe in adults, repre-sent an increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding inpatients over the age of 60.\\nPrecautions\\nNarcotic analgesics may be contraindicated in\\npatients with respiratory depression.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 192}, page_content='Description\\nAnaphylaxis is a type of allergic reaction, in which\\nthe immune system responds to otherwise harmless sub-stances from the environment. Unlike other allergicreactions, however, anaphylaxis can kill. Reaction maybegin within minutes or even seconds of exposure, andrapidly progress to cause airway constriction, skin andintestinal irritation, and altered heart rhythms. In severecases, it can result in complete airway obstruction,shock , and death .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nLike the majority of other allergic reactions, anaphy-\\nlaxis is caused by the release of histamine and otherchemicals from mast cells. Mast cells are a type of whiteblood cell and they are found in large numbers in the tis-sues that regulate exchange with the environment: theairways, digestive system, and skin.\\nOn their surfaces, mast cells display antibodies\\ncalled IgE (immunoglobulin type E). These antibodiesare designed to detect environmental substances towhich the immune system is sensitive. Substances froma genuinely threatening source, such as bacteria orviruses, are called antigens. A substance that most peo-ple tolerate well, but to which others have an allergicresponse, is called an allergen. When IgE antibodiesbind with allergens, they cause the mast cell to releasehistamine and other chemicals, which spill out ontoneighboring cells.\\nThe interaction of these chemicals with receptors on\\nthe surface of blood vessels causes the vessels to leakfluid into surrounding tissues, causing fluid accumula-tion, redness, and swelling. On the smooth muscle cellsof the airways and digestive system, they cause constric-tion. On nerve endings, they increase sensitivity andcause itching .\\nIn anaphylaxis, the dramatic response is due both to\\nextreme hypersensivity to the allergen and its usuallysystemic distribution. Allergens are more likely to causeanaphylaxis if they are introduced directly into the circu-latory system by injection. However, exposure by inges-tion, inhalation, or skin contact can also cause anaphy-laxis. In some cases, anaphylaxis may develop over timefrom less severe allergies .\\nAnaphylaxis is most often due to allergens in foods,\\ndrugs, and insect venom. Specific causes include:\\n• fish, shellfish, and mollusks• nuts and seeds• stings of bees, wasps, or hornets\\n• papain from meat tenderizers• vaccines, including flu and measles vaccines\\n• penicillin• cephalosporins\\n• streptomycin\\n• gamma globulin• insulin• hormones (ACTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone)•aspirin and other NSAIDs\\n• latex, from exam gloves or condoms, for example\\nExposure to cold or exercise can trigger anaphylaxis\\nin some individuals.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms may include:\\n• urticaria ( hives )\\n• swelling and irritation of the tongue or mouth• swelling of the sinuses• difficulty breathing• wheezing• cramping, vomiting, or diarrhea\\n• anxiety or confusion\\n• strong, very rapid heartbeat ( palpitations )\\n• loss of consciousness\\nNot all symptoms may be present.\\nDiagnosis\\nAnaphylaxis is diagnosed based on the rapid devel-\\nopment of symptoms in response to a suspect allergen.Identification of the culprit may be done with RAST test-ing, a blood test that identifies IgE reactions to specificallergens. Skin testing may be done for less severe ana-phylactic reactions.\\nTreatment\\nEmergency treatment of anaphylaxis involves injec-\\ntion of adrenaline (epinephrine) which constricts bloodvessels and counteracts the effects of histamine. Oxygenmay be given, as well as intravenous replacement fluids.Antihistamines may be used for skin rash, and amino-\\nphylline for bronchial constriction. If the upper airway isobstructed, placement of a breathing tube or tracheosto-my tube may be needed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 179AnaphylaxisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 179'),\n",

For most people whoreceive rapid treatment, recovery is complete.\\nPrevention\\nAvoidance of the allergic trigger is the only reliable\\nmethod of preventing anaphylaxis. For insect allergies,this requires recognizing likely nest sites.

Red blood cells, which containhemoglobin that allows them to deliver oxygen throughoutthe body, live for only about 120 days. When they die, theiron they contain is returned to the bone marrow and usedto create new red blood cells. Anemia develops whenheavy bleeding causes significant iron loss or when some-thing happens to slow down the production of red bloodcells or to increase the rate at which they are destroyed.\\nTypes of anemia\\nAnemia can be mild, moderate, or severe enough to\\nlead to life-threatening complications. More than 400different types of anemia have been identified. Many ofthem are rare.\\nIRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Iron deficiency ane-\\nmiais the most common form of anemia in the world. In\\nthe United States, iron deficiency anemia affects about240,000 toddlers between one and two years of age and3.3 million women of childbearing age. This condition isless common in older children and in adults over 50 andrarely occurs in teenage boys and young men.\\nThe onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual and,\\nat first, there may not be any symptoms. The deficiencybegins when the body loses more iron than it derivesfrom food and other sources. Because depleted ironstores cannot meet the red blood cell’s needs, fewer redblood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the redblood cells look normal, but they are reduced in number.Then the body tries to compensate for the iron deficiencyby producing more red blood cells, which are character-istically small in size. Symptoms develop at this stage.\\nFOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Folic acid defi-\\nciency anemia is the most common type of megaloblas-\\ntic anemia (in which red blood cells are bigger than nor-mal). It is caused by a deficiency of folic acid , a vitamin\\nthat the body needs to produce normal cells.\\nFolic acid anemia is especially common in infants\\nand teenagers. Although this condition usually resultsfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to inabilityto absorb enough folic acid from such foods as:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 180AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 180'),\n",

Folic acid anemia can bea complication of pregnancy , when a woman’s body\\nneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.\\nVITAMIN B 12DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. Less common in\\nthis country than folic acid anemia, vitamin B12deficien-\\ncy anemia is another type of megaloblastic anemia thatdevelops when the body doesn’t absorb enough of thisnutrient. Necessary for the creation of red blood cells, B\\n12\\nis found in meat and vegetables.\\nLarge amounts of B12are stored in the body, so this\\ncondition may not become apparent until as much as fouryears after B\\n12absorption stops or slows down. The\\nresulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n• loss of muscle control\\n• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n• soreness or burning of the tongue\\n• weight loss\\n• yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B12deficiency is perni-\\ncious anemia . Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12in their diets , a deficiency of this vitamin\\nusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.This can occur among people who have had intestinalsurgery or among those who do not produce adequateamounts of intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by thestomach lining that combines with B\\n12to help its absorp-\\ntion in the small intestine.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes between the ages\\nof 50–60. Eating disorders or an unbalanced diet increas-es the risk of developing pernicious anemia. So do:\\n• diabetes mellitus•gastritis ,stomach cancer , or stomach surgery\\n• thyroid disease\\n• family history of pernicious anemia\\nVITAMIN C DEFICIENCY ANEMIA. A rare disorder\\nthat causes the bone marrow to manufacture abnormallysmall red blood cells, Vitamin C deficiency anemia\\nresults from a severe, long-standing dietary deficiency.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. Some people are born with\\nhemolytic anemia . Some acquire this condition, in\\nwhich infection or antibodies destroy red blood cellsmore rapidly than bone marrow can replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen, accelerat-\\ning the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Othercomplications of hemolytic anemia include:\\n•pain\\n• shock• gallstones and other serious health problems\\nTHALASSEMIAS. An inherited form of hemolytic\\nanemia, thalassemia stems from the body’s inability to\\nmanufacture as much normal hemoglobin as it needs.There are two categories of thalassemia, depending onwhich of the amino acid chains is affected. (Hemoglobinis composed of four chains of amino acids.) In alpha-tha-lassemia, there is an imbalance in the production of thealpha chain of amino acids; in beta-thalassemia, there isan imbalance in the beta chain. Alpha-thalassemias mostcommonly affect blacks (25% have at least one gene);beta-thalassemias most commonly affect people ofMediterranean ancestry and Southeast Asians.\\nCharacterized by production of red blood cells that\\nare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affectspeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (auto-somal recessive inheritance).\\nAUTOIMMUNE HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS. Warm anti-\\nbody hemolytic anemia is the most common type of thisdisorder. This condition occurs when the body producesautoantibodies that coat red blood cells. The coated cellsare destroyed by the spleen, liver, or bone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common\\nin women than in men. About one-third of patients whohave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-phoma, leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks\\nred blood cells at or below normal body temperature. Theacute form of this condition frequently develops in peo-ple who have had pneumonia , mononeucleosis, or other\\nacute infections. It tends to be mild and short-lived, anddisappears without treatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who areover 40 and who have arthritis. This condition usuallylasts for a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms.However, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 181AnemiasGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 181'),\n",

Sickle cell anemia is a chron-\\nic, incurable condition that causes the body to producedefective hemoglobin, which forces red blood cells toassume an abnormal crescent shape. Unlike normal ovalcells, fragile sickle cells can’t hold enough hemoglobinto nourish body tissues. The deformed shape makes ithard for sickle cells to pass through narrow blood ves-sels. When capillaries become obstructed, a life-threaten-ing condition called sickle cell crisis is likely to occur.\\nSickle cell anemia is hereditary. It almost always\\naffects blacks and people of Mediterranean descent. Achild who inherits the sickle cell gene from each parentwill have the disease. A child who inherits the sickle cellgene from only one parent carries the sickle cell trait, butdoes not have the disease.\\nAPLASTIC ANEMIA. Sometimes curable by bone\\nmarrow transplant, but potentially fatal, aplastic anemia\\nis characterized by decreased production of red andwhite blood cells and platelets (disc-shaped cells thatallow the blood to clot). This disorder may be inheritedor acquired as a result of:\\n• recent severe illness\\n• long-term exposure to industrial chemicals\\n• use of anticancer drugs and certain other medications\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. Cancer , chronic\\ninfection or inflammation, and kidney and liver diseaseoften cause mild or moderate anemia. Chronic liver fail-ure generally produces the most severe symptoms.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnemia is caused by bleeding, decreased red blood\\ncell production, or increased red blood cell destruction.Poor diet can contribute to vitamin deficiency and irondeficiency anemias in which fewer red blood cells areproduced. Hereditary disorders and certain diseases cancause increased blood cell destruction. However, exces-sive bleeding is the most common cause of anemia, andthe speed with which blood loss occurs has a significanteffect on the severity of symptoms. Chronic blood loss isusually a consequence of:\\n• cancer\\n• gastrointestinal tumors\\n• diverticulosis\\n• polyposis\\n• heavy menstrual flow\\n• hemorrhoids• nosebleeds\\n• stomach ulcers\\n• long-standing alcohol abuse\\nAcute blood loss is usually the result of:\\n• childbirth• injury\\n• a ruptured blood vessel\\n• surgery\\nWhen a lot of blood is lost within a short time, blood\\npressure and the amount of oxygen in the body drop sud-denly. Heart failure and death can follow.\\nLoss of even one-third of the body’s blood volume in\\nthe space of several hours can be fatal. More gradual bloodloss is less serious, because the body has time to createnew red blood cells to replace those that have been lost.\\nSymptoms\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia. Skin that is pasty or sallow, or lackof color in the creases of the palm, gums, nail beds, orlining of the eyelids are other signs of anemia. Someonewho is weak, tires easily, is often out of breath, and feelsfaint or dizzy may be severely anemic.\\nOther symptoms of anemia are:\\n• angina pectoris (chest pain, often accompanied by a\\nchoking sensation that provokes severe anxiety )\\n• cravings for ice, paint, or dirt\\n• headache\\n• inability to concentrate, memory loss\\n• inflammation of the mouth ( stomatitis ) or tongue\\n(glossitis)\\n• insomnia\\n• irregular heartbeat\\n• loss of appetite\\n• nails that are dry, brittle, or ridged\\n• rapid breathing\\n• sores in the mouth, throat, or rectum\\n• sweating\\n• swelling of the hands and feet\\n• thirst\\n• tinnitus (ringing in the ears)\\n• unexplained bleeding or bruising\\nIn pernicious anemia, the tongue feels unusually\\nslick.

Laboratory tests thatmeasure the percentage of red blood cells or the amountof hemoglobin in the blood are used to confirm diagnosisand determine which type of anemia is responsible for apatient’s symptoms.

People with folic acid\\nanemia should take oral folic acid replacements. VitaminC deficiency anemia can be cured by taking one vitaminC tablet a day.\\nSurgery may be necessary to treat anemia caused by\\nexcessive loss of blood.

Treatment foraplastic anemia may involve blood transfusions and bonemarrow transplant to replace malfunctioning cells withhealthy ones.\\nANEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE. There is no specific\\ntreatment for anemia associated with chronic disease, buttreating the underlying illness may alleviate this condi-tion. This type of anemia rarely becomes severe. If itdoes, transfusions or hormone treatments to stimulate redblood cell production may be prescribed.\\nHEMOLYTIC ANEMIA. There is no specific treatment\\nfor cold-antibody hemolytic anemia. About one-third ofpatients with warm-antibody hemolytic anemia respondwell to large doses of intravenous and oral corticos-\\nteroids , which are gradually discontinued as the patient’s\\ncondition improves. Patients with this condition whodon’t respond to medical therapy must have the spleensurgically removed.

Ironsupplementation, especially with iron citrate (less likelyto cause constipation ), is used by alternative practition-\\ners. This can be given in combination with herbs that arerich in iron. Some examples of iron-rich herbs are dande-lion ( Taraxacum officinale ), parsley ( Petroselinum\\ncrispum ), and nettle ( Urtica dioica ). The homeopathic\\nremedy ferrum phosphoricum can also be helpful.\\nAn iron-rich herbal tonic can also me made using\\nthe following recipe:\\n• soak 1/2 oz of yellow dock root and 1/2 oz dandelion\\nroot in 1 qt of boiled water for  four to 8 hours\\n• strain and simmer until the amount of liquid is reduced\\nto 1 cup\\n• remove from heat and add 1/2 cup black strap molasses,\\nmixing well\\n• store in refrigerator; take 1 tsp-2 Tbsp daily\\nOther herbal remedies used to treat iron-deficiency\\nanemia aim to improve the digestion. Gentian ( Gentiana\\nlutea ) is widely used in Europe to treat anemia and other\\nnutritionally based disorders. The bitter qualities of gen-tian help stimulate the digestive system, making iron and\\nother nutrients more available for absorption.

The patient experiences analge-\\nsia or a loss of pain sensation but remains consciousand can carry on a conversation.\\n• Stage Two: Excitement. The patient may experience\\ndelirium or become violent. Blood pressure rises and\\nbecomes irregular, and breathing rate increases. Thisstage is typically bypassed by administering a barbitu-rate, such as sodium pentothal, before the anesthesia.\\n• Stage Three: Surgical Anesthesia. During this stage, the\\nskeletal muscles relax, and the patient’s breathingbecomes regular. Eye movements slow, then stop, andsurgery can begin.\\n• Stage Four: Medullary Paralysis . This stage occurs if\\nthe respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata of thebrain that control breathing and other vital functionscease to function. Death can result if the patient cannot\\nbe revived quickly. This stage should never be reached.Careful control of the amounts of anesthetics adminis-tered prevent this occurrence.\\nAgents used for general anesthesia may be either\\ngases or volatile liquids that are vaporized and inhaledwith oxygen, or drugs delivered intravenously. A combi-nation of inhaled anesthetic gases and intravenous drugsare usually delivered during general anesthesia; thispractice is called balanced anesthesia and is used becauseit takes advantage of the beneficial effects of each anes-thetic agent to reach surgical anesthesia. If necessary, theextent of the anesthesia produced by inhaling a generalanesthetic can be rapidly modified by adjusting the con-centration of the anesthetic in the oxygen that is breathedby the patient. The degree of anesthesia produced by anintravenously injected anesthesic is fixed and cannot bechanged as rapidly. Most commonly, intravenous anes-thetic agents are used for induction of anesthesia andthen followed by inhaled anesthetic agents.\\nGeneral anesthesia works by altering the flow of\\nsodium molecules into nerve cells (neurons) through thecell membrane. Exactly how the anesthetic does this isnot understood since the drug apparently does not bind toany receptor on the cell surface and does not seem toaffect the release of chemicals that transmit nerveimpulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells. It isknown, however, that when the sodium molecules do notget into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generatedand the brain becomes unconscious, does not store mem-ories, does not register pain impulses from other areas ofthe body, and does not control involuntary reflexes.Although anesthesia may feel like deep sleep, it is not thesame. In sleep, some parts of the brain speed up whileothers slow down. Under anesthesia, the loss of con-sciousness is more widespread.When general anesthesia was first introduced in\\nmedical practice, ether and chloroform were inhaled withthe physician manually covering the patient’s mouth.Since then, general anesthesia has become much moresophisticated. During most surgical procedures, anesthet-ic agents are now delivered and controlled by computer-ized equipment that includes anesthetic gas monitoringas well as patient monitoring equipment. Anesthesiolo-gists are the physicians that specialize in the delivery ofanesthetic agents. Currently used inhaled general anes-thetics include halothane, enflurane, isoflurane, desfluo-rane, sevofluorane, and nitrous oxide.\\n• Halothane (Fluothane) is a powerful anesthetic and can\\neasily be overadministered. This drug causes uncon-sciousness but little pain relief so it is often used withother agents to control pain. Very rarely, it can be toxicto the liver in adults, causing death. It also has thepotential for causing serious cardiac dysrhythmias.Halothane has a pleasant odor, and was frequently theanesthetic of choice for use with children, but since theintroduction of sevofluorane in the 1990s, halothaneuse has declined.\\n• Enflurane (Ethrane) is less potent and results in a\\nmore rapid onset of anesthesia and faster awakeningthan halothane. In addition, it acts as an enhancer ofparalyzing agents. Enflurane has been found toincrease intracranial pressure and the risk of seizures;therefore, its use is contraindicated in patients withseizure disorders.\\n• Isoflurane (Forane) is not toxic to the liver but can\\ncause some cardiac irregularities. Isofluorane is oftenused in combination with intravenous anesthetics foranesthesia induction. Awakening from anesthesia isfaster than it is with halothane and enfluorane.\\n• Desfluorane (Suprane) may increase the heart rate and\\nshould not be used in patients with aortic valve steno-\\nsis; however, it does not usually cause heart arrhyth-\\nmias . Desflurane may cause coughing and excitation\\nduring induction and is therefore used with intravenousanesthetics for induction. Desflurane is rapidly elimi-nated and awakening is therefore faster than with otherinhaled agents.\\n• Sevofluorane (Ultane) may also cause increased heart\\nrate and should not be used in patients with narrowedaortic valve (stenosis); however, it does not usuallycause heart arrhythmias. Unlike desfluorane, sevofluo-rane does not cause any coughing or other related sideeffects, and can therefore be used without intravenousagents for rapid induction. For this reason, sevofluoraneis replacing halothane for induction in pediatricpatients. Like desfluorane, this agent is rapidly elimi-nated and allows rapid awakening.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 186Anesthesia, generalGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 186'),\n",

It has the fastest induction andrecovery and is the safest because it does not slowbreathing or blood flow to the brain. However, it diffus-es rapidly into air-containing cavities and can result in acollapsed lung ( pneumothorax ) or lower the oxygen\\ncontents of tissues (hypoxia).\\nCommonly administered intravenous anesthetic\\nagents include ketamine, thiopental, opioids, and propofol.\\n• Ketamine (Ketalar) affects the senses, and produces a\\ndissociative anesthesia ( catatonia , amnesia, analgesia)\\nin which the patient may appear awake and reactive, butcannot respond to sensory stimuli. These propertiesmake it especially useful for use in developing coun-tries and during warfare medical treatment. Ketamine isfrequently used in pediatric patients because anesthesiaand analgesia can be achieved with an intramuscularinjection. It is also used in high-risk geriatric patientsand in shock cases, because it also provides cardiac\\nstimulation.\\n• Thiopental (Pentothal) is a barbiturate that induces a\\nrapid hypnotic state of short duration. Because thiopen-tal is slowly metabolized by the liver, toxic accumula-tion can occur; therefore, it should not be continuouslyinfused. Side effects include nausea and vomiting\\nupon awakening.\\n• Opioids include fentanyl, sufentanil, and alfentanil, and\\nare frequently used prior to anesthesia and surgery as asedative and analgesic, as well as a continuous infusionfor primary anesthesia. Because opioids rarely affectthe cardiovascular system, they are particularly usefulfor cardiac surgery and other high-risk cases. Opioidsact directly on spinal cord receptors, and are freqentlyused in epidurals for spinal anesthesia. Side effects mayinclude nausea and vomiting, itching , and respiratory\\ndepression.\\n• Propofol (Diprivan) is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic agent\\nand the most recently developed intravenous anesthetic.Its rapid induction and short duration of action are iden-tical to thiopental, but recovery occurs more quicklyand with much less nausea and vomiting. Also, propo-fol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and excreted inthe urine, so it can be used for long durations of anes-thesia, unlike thiopental. Hence, propofol is rapidlyreplacing thiopental as an intravenous induction agent.It is used for general surgery , cardiac surgery, neuro-\\nsurgery, and pediatric surgery.\\nGeneral anesthetics are given only by anesthesiolo-\\ngists, the medical professionals trained to use them. Thesespecialists consider many factors, including a patient’sage, weight, medication allergies , medical history, andgeneral health, when deciding which anesthetic or combi-\\nnation of anesthetics to use. General anesthetics are usual-ly inhaled through a mask or a breathing tube or injectedinto a vein, but are also sometimes given rectally.\\nGeneral anesthesia is much safer today than it was in\\nthe past. This progress is due to faster-acting anesthetics,improved safety standards in the equipment used todeliver the drugs, and better devices to monitor breath-ing, heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity duringsurgery. Unpleasant side effects are also less common.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dosage depends on the type of anesthetic, the\\npatient’s age and physical condition, the type of surgeryor medical procedure being done, and other medicationthe patient takes before, during, or after surgery.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the risks of serious complications from\\ngeneral anesthesia are very low, they can include heart\\nattack ,stroke , brain damage, and death. Anyone sched-\\nuled to undergo general anesthesia should thoroughlydiscuss the benefits and risks with a physician. The risksof complications depend, in part, on a patient’s age, sex,weight, allergies, general health, and history of smoking ,\\ndrinking alcohol, or drug use. Some of these risks can beminimized by ensuring that the physician and anesthesi-ologist are fully informed of the detailed health conditionof the patient, including any drugs that he or she may beusing. Older people are especially sensitive to the effectsof certain anesthetics and may be more likely to experi-ence side effects from these drugs.\\nPatients who have had general anesthesia should not\\ndrink alcoholic beverages or take medication that slowdown the central nervous system (such as antihista-\\nmines , sedatives, tranquilizers, sleep aids, certain pain\\nrelievers, muscle relaxants , and anti-seizure medication)\\nfor at least 24 hours, except under a doctor’s care.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions are at greater\\nrisk of developing problems with anesthetics.

Signs of malignant\\nhyperthermia include rapid, irregular heartbeat, breath-ing problems, very high fever , and muscle tightness or\\nspasms. These symptoms can occur following the admin-istration of general anesthesia using inhaled agents, espe-cially halothane. In addition, the doctor should also betold about any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, orother substances.\\nPREGNANCY. The effects of anesthetics on pregnant\\nwomen and fetuses vary, depending on the type of drug. Ingeneral, giving large amounts of general anesthetics to themother during labor and delivery may make the baby slug-gish after delivery. Pregnant women should discuss the useof anesthetics during labor and delivery with their doctors.Pregnant women who may be given general anesthesia forother medical procedures should ensure that the treatingphysician is informed about the pregnancy .\\nBREASTFEEDING.

Over-the-counter local anesthetics are also avail-able to provide temporary relief from pain, irritation, anditching caused by various conditions, such as cold sores,\\ncanker sores , sore throats, sunburn , insect bites, poison\\nivy, and minor cuts and scratches.\\nTypes of surgery or medical procedures that regular-\\nly make use of local or regional anesthesia include thefollowing:\\n• biopsies in which skin or tissue samples are taken for\\ndiagnostic procedures\\n• childbirth\\n• surgeries on the arms, hands, legs, or feet\\n• eye surgery\\n• surgeries involving the urinary tract or sexual organs\\nSurgeries involving the chest and abdomen are usu-\\nally performed under general anesthesia.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia have advantages over\\ngeneral anesthesia in that patients can avoid someunpleasant side effects, can receive longer lasting painrelief, have reduced blood loss, and maintain a sense ofpsychological comfort by not losing consciousness.\\nDescription\\nRegional anesthesia typically affects a larger area than\\nlocal anesthesia, for example, everything below the waist.As a result, regional anesthesia may be used for moreinvolved or complicated surgical or medical procedures.Regional anesthetics are injected. Local anesthesia involvesthe injection into the skin or muscle or application to theskin of an anesthetic directly where pain will occur. Localanesthesia can be divided into four groups: injectable, topi-cal, dental (non-injectable), and ophthalmic.\\nLocal and regional anesthesia work by altering the\\nflow of sodium molecules into nerve cells or neuronsthrough the cell membrane. Exactly how the anestheticdoes this is not understood, since the drug apparentlydoes not bind to any receptor on the cell surface and doesnot seem to affect the release of chemicals that transmitnerve impulses (neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.It is known, however, that when the sodium molecules donot get into the neurons, nerve impulses are not generat-ed and pain impulses are not transmitted to the brain. Theduration of action of an anesthetic depends on the typeand amount of anesthetic administered.\\nRegional anesthesia\\nTypes of regional anesthesia include:• Spinal anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia involves the injec-\\ntion of a small amount of local anesthetic directly intothe cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the spinal cord (thesubarachnoid space). Blood pressure drops are com-mon but are easily treated.\\n• Epidural anesthesia. Epidural anesthesia involves the\\ninjection of a large volume of local anesthetic directlyinto the space surrounding the spinal fluid sac (theepidural space), not into the spinal fluid. Pain reliefoccurs more slowly but is less likely to produce bloodpressure drops. Also, the block can be maintained forlong periods, even days.\\n• Nerve blocks. Nerve blocks involve the injection of an\\nanesthetic into the area around a nerve that supplies aparticular region of the body, preventing the nerve fromcarrying nerve impulses to the brain.\\nAnesthetics may be administered with another drug,\\nsuch as epinephrine (adrenaline), which decreases bleed-ing, and sodium bicarbonate to decrease the acidity of adrug so that it will work faster. In addition, drugs may beadministered to help a patient remain calm and morecomfortable or to make them sleepy.\\nLocal anesthesia\\nINJECTABLE LOCAL ANESTHETICS. These medicines\\nare given by injection to numb and provide pain relief tosome part of the body during surgery, dental procedures,or other medical procedures. They are given only by atrained health care professional and only in a doctor’soffice or a hospital. Some commonly used injectablelocal anesthetics are procaine (Novocain), lidocaine(Dalcaine, Dilocaine, L-Caine, Nervocaine, Xylocaine,and other brands), and tetracaine (Pontocaine).\\nTOPICAL ANESTHETICS. Topical anesthetics, such as\\nbenzocaine, lidocaine, dibucaine, pramoxine, butamben,and tetracaine, relieve pain and itching by deadening thenerve endings in the skin. They are ingredients in a vari-ety of nonprescription products that are applied to theskin to relieve the discomfort of sunburn, insect bites orstings, poison ivy, and minor cuts, scratches, and burns .\\nThese products are sold as creams, ointments, sprays,lotions, and gels.\\nDENTAL ANESTHETICS (NON-INJECTABLE). Some\\nlocal anesthetics are intended for pain relief in the mouthor throat. They may be used to relieve throat pain,teething pain, painful canker sores, toothaches, or dis-comfort from dentures, braces, or bridgework. Somedental anesthetics are available only with a doctor’s pre-scription. Others may be purchased without a prescrip-tion, including products such as Num-Zit, Orajel, Chlo-raseptic lozenges, and Xylocaine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 190Anesthesia, localGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 190'),\n",

The ophthalmic anestheticsproparacaine and tetracaine are used to numb the eyebefore certain eye examinations. Eye doctors may also usethese medicines before measuring eye pressure or remov-ing stitches or foreign objects from the eye. These drugs\\nare to be given only by a trained health care professional.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nlocal anesthetic and the purpose for which it is beingused. When using a nonprescription local anesthetic, fol-low the directions on the package. Questions concerninghow to use a product should be referred to a medical doc-tor, dentist, or pharmacist.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople who strongly feel that they cannot psycho-\\nlogically cope with being awake and alert during certainprocedures may not be good candidates for local orregional anesthesia. Other medications may be given inconjunction with the anesthetic, however, to relieve anxi-\\netyand help the patient relax.\\nLocal anesthetics should be used only for the condi-\\ntions for which they are intended. For example, a topicalanesthetic meant to relieve sunburn pain should not beused on cold sores. Anyone who has had an unusual reac-tion to any local anesthetic in the past should check witha doctor before using any type of local anesthetic again.The doctor should also be told about any allergies to\\nfoods, dyes, preservatives, or other substances.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to the effects of\\nlocal anesthetics, especially lidocaine. This increased sen-sitivity may increase the risk of side effects. Older peoplewho use nonprescription local anesthetics should be espe-cially careful not to use more than the recommendedamount. Children also may be especially sensitive to theeffects of some local anesthetics, which may increase thechance of side effects. Anyone using these medicines on achild should be careful not to use more than the amountthat is recommended for children. Certain types of localanesthetics should not be used at all young children. Fol-low package directions carefully and check with a doctorof pharmacist if there are any questions.\\nRegional anesthetics\\nSerious, possibly life-threatening, side effects may\\noccur when anesthetics are given to people who usestreet drugs. Anyone who uses cocaine ,marijuana ,\\namphetamines, barbiturates , phencyclidine (PCP, or\\nangel dust), heroin, or other street drugs should makesure their doctor or dentist knows what they have used.Patients who have had a particular kind of reaction\\ncalled malignant hyperthermia (or who have one or morefamily members who have had this problem) during orjust after receiving a general anesthetic should informtheir doctors before receiving any kind of anesthetic.Signs of malignant hyperthermia include fast and irregu-lar heartbeat, very high fever , breathing problems, and\\nmuscle spasms or tightness.\\nAlthough problems are rare, some unwanted side\\neffects may occur when regional anesthetics are usedduring labor and delivery. These anesthetics can prolonglabor and increase the risk of Cesarean section . Preg-\\nnant women should discuss with their doctors the risksand benefits of being given these drugs.\\nPatients should not drive or operate other machinery\\nimmediately following a procedure involving regionalanesthesia, due to numbness and weakness, or if localanesthesia also included drugs to make the patient sleepor strong pain medications. Injection sites should be keptclean, dry, and uncovered to prevent infection.\\nInjectable local anesthetics\\nUntil the anesthetic wears off, patients should be\\ncareful not to injure the numbed area. If the anestheticwas used in the mouth, do not eat or chew gum until feel-ing returns.\\nTopical anesthetics\\nUnless advised by a doctor, topical anesthetics\\nshould not be used on or near any part of the bodywith large sores, broken or scraped skin, severe injury,or infection. They should also not be used on largeareas of skin. Some topical anesthetics contain alcoholand should not be used near an open flame, or whilesmoking .\\nAnyone using a topical anesthetic should be careful\\nnot to get this medication in the eyes, nose, or mouth.When using a spray form of this medication, do not sprayit directly on the face, but apply it to the face with a cot-ton swab or sterile gauze pad. After using a topical anes-thetic on a child, make sure the child does not get themedicine in his or her mouth.\\nTopical anesthetics are intended for the temporary\\nrelief of pain and itching.

The aorta is the largestartery in the body and the main blood vessel leadingaway from the heart.\\nPurpose\\nThe purpose of aneurysmectomy is to repair an aor-\\ntic aneurysm that is likely to rupture if left in place.\\nAneurysmectomy is indicated for an aortic aneurysm thatgrows to at least 2 in (5 cm) or for an aortic aneurysm ofany size that is symptomatic, tender, or enlarging rapidly.\\nPrecautions\\nAneurysmectomy may not be appropriate for\\npatients with severely debilitating diseases such as can-\\ncer,emphysema , and heart failure .\\nDescription\\nAn aortic aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of the aorta\\nthat is usually due to arteriosclerosis or atherosclerosis .\\nPeople who are 50-80 years old are most likely to devel-op an aortic aneurysm, with men four times more likelyto develop one than women.\\nAn aortic aneurysm develops and grows slowly. It\\nrarely produces symptoms and is usually only diagnosedby accident during a routine physical exam or on an x rayor ultrasound done for another reason. As the aneurysmgrows larger, the risk of bursting with no warning, whichcauses catastrophic bleeding, rises. A ruptured aorticaneurysm can cause sudden loss of a fatal amount of bloodwithin minutes or it can leak in a series of small bleedsthat lead within hours or days to massive bleeding. A leak-ing aortic aneurysm that is not treated is always fatal.Aneurysmectomy is performed to repair the two\\nmost common types of aortic aneurysms: abdominal aor-tic aneurysms that occur in the abdomen below the kid-neys, and thoracic aortic aneurysms that occur in thechest. It is major surgery performed in a hospital undergeneral anesthesia and involves removing debris andthen implanting a flexible tube (graft) to replace theenlarged artery. Aneurysmectomy for an aneurysm of theascending aorta (the first part of the aorta that travelsupward from the heart) requires the use of a heart-lungmachine that temporarily stops the heart while theaneurysm is repaired. Aneurysmectomy requires a one-week hospital stay; the recovery period is five weeks.\\nDuring surgery, the site of the aneurysm (either the\\nabdomen or the chest) is opened with an incision to exposethe aneurysm. The aorta is clamped above and below theaneurysm to stop the flow of blood. Then, an incision ismade in the aneurysm. An artificial Dacron tube is sewn inplace above and below the opened aneurysm, but theaneurysm is not removed. Plaque or clotted blood arecleaned from the diseased tissue. The clamps are removedand blood flow is re-established through the graft. Thewall of the aneurysm is wrapped around the graft to pro-tect it and the skin of the abdomen or chest is sewn up.\\nAneurysmectomy can be performed as elective or\\nemergency surgery. Elective aneurysmectomy takes aboutan hour and is far safer than emergency aneurysmectomy,with a mortality rate of 3-5% for elective abdominalaneurysmectomy and 5-10% for elective thoracicaneurysmectomy. When an aneurysm ruptures, 62% ofpatients die before they reach the hospital. Of those whomake it into emergency aneurysmectromy, 50% die. Aftera successful aneurysmectomy, the patient has nearly thesame life expectancy as other people of the same age.\\nPreparation\\nBefore elective aneurysmectomy, blood studies, a\\nchest x ray , cardiac catherization, electrocardiogram\\n(ECG), and ultrasound are performed.\\nAftercare\\nAfter aneurysmectomy, the patient is monitored in\\nan Intensive Care Unit for the first 24–48 hours. Follow-up tests include ECG, chest x ray, and ultrasound.\\nRisks\\nElective aneurysmectomy has a 5-10% rate of compli-\\ncations, such as bleeding, kidney failure, respiratory com-plications, heart attack ,stroke , infection, limb loss, bowel\\nischemia , and impotence . These complications are many\\ntimes more common in emergency aneurysmectomy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 193AneurysmectomyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 193'),\n",

It is also some-\\ntimes characterized by a feeling of choking , suffocation,\\nor crushing heaviness. This condition is also called angi-na pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-\\nsation, the term “angina” is used primarily to describechest (thoracic) pain originating from insufficient oxygento the heart muscle. An episode of angina is not an actualheart attack , but rather pain that results from the heart\\nmuscle temporarily receiving too little blood. This tem-porary condition may be the result of demanding activi-ties such as exercise and does not necessarily indicate\\nthat the heart muscle is experiencing permanent damage.In fact, episodes of angina seldom cause permanent dam-age to heart muscle.\\nAngina can be subdivided further into two cate-\\ngories: angina of effort and variant angina.\\nAngina of effort\\nAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by the\\nnarrowing of the arteries ( atherosclerosis ) that supply\\noxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle. In the case ofangina of effort, the heart (coronary) arteries can providethe heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood duringrest but not during periods of exercise, stress , or excite-\\nment—any of which may precipitate pain. The pain isrelieved by resting or by administering nitroglycerin, amedication that reduces ischemia of the heart. Patientswith angina of effort have an increased risk of heartattack (myocardial infarction).\\nV ariant angina\\nVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-\\ndently of atherosclerosis which may, however, be presentas an incidental finding. Variant angina occurs at rest andis not related to excessive work by the heart muscle.Research indicates that variant angina is caused by coro-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 194AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 194'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='nary artery muscle spasm of insufficient duration or\\nintensity to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-\\nness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone (ster-num). It occasionally is experienced in the shoulder, arm,neck, or jaw regions. Because episodes of angina occurwhen the heart’s need for oxygen increases beyond theoxygen available from the blood nourishing the heart, thecondition is often precipitated by physical exertion. Inmost cases, the symptoms are relieved within a few min-utes by resting or by taking prescribed angina medica-tions. Emotional stress, extreme temperatures, heavymeals, cigarette smoking , and alcohol can also cause or\\ncontribute to an episode of angina.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on the\\npatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-er, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm orrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-lying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical\\nimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electricalactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioningproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-grams are also useful in investigating other possibleabnormal features of the heart.\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of an\\nelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-malities. Because the symptoms of angina occur duringstress, the functioning of the heart may need to be evalu-ated under the physical stress of exercise. The stress test\\nrecords information from the electrocardiogram before,during, and after exercise in search of stress-relatedabnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured duringthe stress test and symptoms are noted. A more involvedand complex stress test (for example, thallium scanning)may be used in some cases to picture the blood flow inthe heart muscle during the most intense time of exerciseand after rest.\\nAngiogram\\nThe angiogram, which is basically an x ray of the\\ncoronary artery, has been noted to be the most accuratediagnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of\\ncoronary disease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexibletube (catheter) is maneuvered into an artery located inthe forearm or groin. This catheter is passed furtherthrough the artery into one of the two major coronaryarteries. A dye is injected at that time to help the x rays“see” the heart and arteries more clearly. Many brief xrays are made to create a “movie” of blood flowingthrough the coronary arteries, which will reveal any pos-sible narrowing that causes a decrease in blood flow tothe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment\\nArtery disease causing angina is addressed initially by\\ncontrolling existing factors placing the individual at risk.These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high bloodpressure, high cholesterol levels, and obesity . Angina is\\noften controlled by medication, most commonly withnitroglycerin. This drug relieves symptoms of angina byincreasing the diameter of the blood vessels carryingblood to the heart muscle. Nitroglycerin is taken wheneverdiscomfort occurs or is expected. It may be taken bymouth by placing the tablet under the tongue or transder-mally by placing a medicated patch directly on the skin. Inaddition, beta blockers or calcium channel blockers\\nmay be prescribed to also decrease the demand on theheart by decreasing the rate and workload of the heart.\\nSurgical treatment\\nWhen conservative treatments are not effective in\\nthe reduction of angina pain and the risk of heart attackremains high, physicians may recommend angioplasty\\nor surgery. Coronary artery bypass surgery is an opera-tion in which a blood vessel (often a long vein surgicallyremoved from the leg) is grafted onto the blocked arteryto bypass the blocked portion. This newly formed path-way allows blood to flow adequately to the heart muscle.\\nAnother procedure used to improve blood flow to\\nthe heart is balloon angioplasty. In this procedure, thephysician inserts a catheter with a tiny balloon at the endinto a forearm or groin artery. The catheter is then thread-ed up into the coronary arteries and the balloon is inflat-ed to open the vessel in narrowed sections. Other tech-niques using laser and mechanical devices are beingdeveloped and applied, also by means of catheters.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDuring an angina episode, relief has been noted by\\napplying massage or kinesiological methods, but thesetechniques are not standard recommendations by physi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 195AnginaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 195'),\n",

For example, one technique places the palm and\\nfingers of either hand on the forehead while simultane-ously firmly massaging the sternum (breast bone) up anddown its entire length using the other hand. This is fol-lowed by additional massaging by the fingertip andthumb next to the sternum, on each side.\\nOnce the angina has subsided, the cause should be\\ndetermined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associat-ed cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, primari-ly including regular exercise, reduction of dietary sugarand saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber. Both con-ventional and alternative medicine agree that increasingexercise and improving diet are important steps to reducehigh cholesterol levels. Alternative medicine has pro-posed specific cholesterol-lowering treatments, with sev-eral gaining the attention and interest of the public. Oneof the most recent popular treatments is garlic ( Allium\\nsativum ). Some studies have shown that adequate dosages\\nof garlic can reduce total cholesterol by about 10%, LDL(bad) cholesterol by 15%, and raise HDL (good) choles-terol by 10%. Other studies have not shown significantbenefit. Although its effect on cholesterol is not as greatas that achieved by medications, garlic may possibly be ofbenefit in relatively mild cases of high cholesterol, with-out causing the side effects associated with cholesterol-\\nreducing drugs . Other herbal remedies that may help\\nlower cholesterol include alfalfa ( Medicago sativa ), fenu-\\ngreek ( Trigonella foenum-graecum ), Asian ginseng\\n(Panax ginseng ), and tumeric ( Curcuma longa ).\\nAntioxidants, including vitamin A (beta carotene),\\nvitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium, can limit the oxida-tive damage to the walls of blood vessels that may be aprecursor of atherosclerotic plaque formation.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for a patient with angina depends on\\nits origin, type, severity, and the general health of theindividual. A person who has angina has the best progno-sis if he or she seeks prompt medical attention and learnsthe pattern of his or her angina, such as what causes theattacks, what they feel like, how long episodes usuallylast, and whether medication relieves the attacks. If pat-terns of the symptoms change significantly, or if symp-toms resemble those of a heart attack, medical helpshould be sought immediately.\\nPrevention\\nIn most cases, the best prevention involves changing\\none’s habits to avoid bringing on attacks of angina. Ifblood pressure medication has been prescribed, compli-ance is a necessity and should be a priority as well.

Arteriography is\\na type of angiography that involves the study of the arteries.\\nPurpose\\nAngiography is used to detect abnormalities or\\nblockages in the blood vessels (called occlusions)throughout the circulatory system and in some organs.The procedure is commonly used to identify atheroscle-\\nrosis ; to diagnose heart disease; to evaluate kidney func-\\ntion and detect kidney cysts or tumors; to detect ananeurysm (an abnormal bulge of an artery that can rup-ture leading to hemorrhage), tumor, blood clot, or arteri-\\novenous malformations (abnormals tangles of arteries\\nand veins) in the brain; and to diagnose problems withthe retina of the eye. It is also used to give surgeons anaccurate “map” of the heart prior to open-heart surgery,or of the brain prior to neurosurgery.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with kidney disease or injury may suffer\\nfurther kidney damage from the contrast mediums usedfor angiography. Patients who have blood clotting prob-lems, have a known allergy to contrast mediums, or areallergic to iodine, a component of some contrast medi-ums, may also not be suitable candidates for an angiogra-phy procedure. Because x rays carry risks of ionizingradiation exposure to the fetus, pregnant women are alsoadvised to avoid this procedure.\\nDescription\\nAngiography is usually performed at a hospital by a\\ntrained radiologist and assisting technician or nurse. Ittakes place in an x-ray or fluoroscopy suite, and for mosttypes of angiograms, the patient’s vital signs will bemonitored throughout the procedure.\\nAngiography requires the injection of a contrast dye\\nthat makes the blood vessels visible to x ray. The dye isinjected through a procedure known as arterial puncture .\\nThe puncture is usually made in the groin area, armpit,inside elbow, or neck. The site is cleaned with an antisep-tic agent and injected with a local anesthetic. First, asmall incision is made in the skin to help the needle pass.A needle containing an inner wire called a stylet is insert-ed through the skin into the artery. When the radiologisthas punctured the artery with the needle, the stylet isremoved and replaced with another long wire called aguide wire. It is normal for blood to spout out of the nee-dle before the guide wire is inserted.\\nThe guide wire is fed through the outer needle into\\nthe artery and to the area that requires angiographicstudy. A fluoroscopic screen that displays a view of the\\npatient’s vascular system is used to pilot the wire to thecorrect location. Once it is in position, the needle isremoved and a catheter is slid over the length of theguide wire until it to reaches the area of study. The guidewire is removed and the catheter is left in place in prepa-ration for the injection of the contrast medium, or dye.\\nDepending on the type of angiography procedure\\nbeing performed, the contrast medium is either injectedby hand with a syringe or is mechanically injected withan automatic injector connected to the catheter. Anautomatic injector is used frequently because it is ableto propel a large volume of dye very quickly to theangiogram site. The patient is warned that the injectionwill start, and instructed to remain very still. The injec-tion causes some mild to moderate discomfort. Possibleside effects or reactions include headache ,dizziness ,\\nirregular heartbeat, nausea, warmth, burning sensation,and chest pain , but they usually last only momentarily.\\nTo view the area of study from different angles or per-spectives, the patient may be asked to change positionsseveral times, and subsequent dye injections may beadministered. During any injection, the patient or thecamera may move.\\nThroughout the dye injection procedure, x-ray pic-\\ntures and/or fluoroscopic pictures (or moving x rays) willbe taken. Because of the high pressure of arterial bloodflow, the dye will dissipate through the patient’s systemquickly, so pictures must be taken in rapid succession.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 197Angiography\\nAn angiogram of a coronary artery.

Pressure isapplied to the site with a sandbag or other weight for 10-20 minutes in order for clotting to take place and thearterial puncture to reseal itself. A pressure bandage isthen applied.\\nMost angiograms follow the general procedures out-\\nlined above, but vary slightly depending on the area ofthe vascular system being studied. A variety of commonangiography procedures are outlined below:\\nCerebral angiography\\nCerebral angiography is used to detect aneurysms,\\nblood clots, and other vascular irregularities in the brain.The catheter is inserted into the femoral or carotid arteryand the injected contrast medium travels through theblood vessels on the brain. Patients frequently experienceheadache, warmth, or a burning sensation in the head orneck during the injection portion of the procedure. Acerebral angiogram takes two to four hours to complete.\\nCoronary angiography\\nCoronary angiography is administered by a cardiol-\\nogist with training in radiology or, occasionally, by aradiologist. The arterial puncture is typically given in thefemoral artery, and the cardiologist uses a guide wire andcatheter to perform a contrast injection and x-ray serieson the coronary arteries. The catheter may also be placedin the left ventricle to examine the mitral and aorticvalves of the heart. If the cardiologist requires a view ofthe right ventricle of the heart or of the tricuspid or pul-monic valves, the catheter will be inserted through alarge vein and guided into the right ventricle. Thecatheter also serves the purpose of monitoring bloodpressures in these different locations inside the heart. Theangiogram procedure takes several hours, depending onthe complexity of the procedure.\\nPulmonary angiography\\nPulmonary, or lung, angiography is performed to\\nevaluate blood circulation to the lungs. It is also consid-ered the most accurate diagnostic test for detecting a pul-\\nmonary embolism . The procedure differs from cerebral\\nand coronary angiograms in that the guide wire andcatheter are inserted into a vein instead of an artery, andare guided up through the chambers of the heart and intothe pulmonary artery. Throughout the procedure, thepatient’s vital signs are monitored to ensure that thecatheter doesn’t cause arrhythmias , or irregular heart-beats. The contrast medium is then injected into the pul-\\nmonary artery where it circulates through the lung capil-laries. The test typically takes up to 90 minutes.\\nKidney angiography\\nPatients with chronic renal disease or injury can suf-\\nfer further damage to their kidneys from the contrastmedium used in a kidney angiogram, yet they oftenrequire the test to evaluate kidney function. Thesepatients should be well-hydrated with a intravenoussaline drip before the procedure, and may benefit fromavailable medications (e.g., dopamine) that help to pro-tect the kidney from further injury due to contrast agents.During a kidney angiogram, the guide wire and catheterare inserted into the femoral artery in the groin area andadvanced through the abdominal aorta, the main artery inthe abdomen, and into the renal arteries. The procedurewill take approximately one hour.\\nFluorescein angiography\\nFluorescein angiography is used to diagnose retinal\\nproblems and circulatory disorders. It is typically con-ducted as an outpatient procedure. The patient’s pupilsare dilated with eye drops and he rests his chin and fore-head against a bracing apparatus to keep it still. Sodiumfluorescein dye is then injected with a syringe into a veinin the patient’s arm. The dye will travel through thepatient’s body and into the blood vessels of the eye. Theprocedure does not require x rays. Instead, a rapid seriesof close-up photographs of the patient’s eyes are taken,one set immediately after the dye is injected, and a sec-ond set approximately 20 minutes later once the dye hasmoved through the patient’s vascular system. The entireprocedure takes up to one hour.\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography\\nCeliac and mesenteric angiography involves x-ray\\nexploration of the celiac and mesenteric arteries, arterialbranches of the abdominal aorta that supply blood to theabdomen and digestive system. The test is commonlyused to detect aneurysm, thrombosis, and signs ofischemia in the celiac and mesenteric arteries, and to\\nlocate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding. It is alsoused in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, includ-ing portal hypertension , and cirrhosis . The procedure\\ncan take up to three hours, depending on the number ofblood vessels studied.\\nSplenoportography\\nA splenoportograph is a variation of an angiogram\\nthat involves the injection of contrast medium directlyinto the spleen to view the splenic and portal veins.

If the arterial puncture was performed in thefemoral artery, the patient will be instructed to keep hisleg straight and relatively immobile during the observa-tion period. The patient’s blood pressure and vital signswill be monitored and the puncture site observed closely.Pain medication may be prescribed if the patient is expe-riencing discomfort from the puncture, and a cold pack isapplied to the site to reduce swelling.

Thereare various types of these procedures and their names areassociated with the type of vessel entry and equipmentused. For example, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty(PTA) describes entry through the skin (percutaneous) andnavigates to the area of the vessel of interest through thesame vessel or one that communicates with it (translumi-nal). In the case of a procedure involving the coronaryarteries, the point of entry could be the femoral artery in thegroin and the catheter/guidewire system is passed throughthe aorta to the heart and the origin of the coronary arteriesat the base of the aorta just outside the aortic valve.\\nPurpose\\nIn individuals with an occulsive vascular disease\\nsuch as atherosclerosis , blood flow is impaired to an\\norgan (such as the heart) or to a distal body part ( such asthe lower leg) by the narrowing of the vessel’s lumen dueto fatty deposits or calcium accumulation. This narrow-ing may occur in any vessel but may occur anywhere.Once the vessel has been widened, adequate blood flowis returned. The vessel may narrow again over time at thesame location and the procedure could be repeated.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 200AngioplastyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 200'),\n",

If the procedure is to be performed in a coronaryartery, the patient’s care is likely to be provided by spe-cially trained physicians, nurses, and vascular specialists.Typically, patients are given anticoagulants prior to theprocedure to assist in the prevention of thromboses(blood clots). Administration of anticoagulants, however,may impede the sealing of the vascular entry point. Theprocedure will be performed using fluoroscopic guidanceand contrast media. Since the decision to perform angio-plasty may have been made following a diagnosticangiogram, the patient’s sensitivity to iodinated contrastmedia is likely to known. The procedure may thenrequire the use of non-ionic contrast agents.\\nDescription\\nAngioplasty was originally performed by dilating the\\nvessel with the introduction of larger and larger stiffcatheters through the narrowed space. Complications ofthis procedure caused researchers to develop means ofwidening the vessel using a minimally sized device.Today, catheters contain balloons that are inflated to widenthe vessel and stents to provide structural support for thevessel. Lasers may be used to assist in the break up of thefat or calcium plaque. Catheters may also be equippedwith spinning wires or drill tips to clean out the plaque.\\nAngioplasty may be performed while the patient is\\nsedated or anesthetized, depending on the vesselsinvolved. If a percutaneous transluminal coronary angio-\\nplasty (PTCA) is to be performed, the patient will bekept awake to report on discomfort and cough if\\nrequired. PTCA procedures are performed in cardiac\\ncatheterization labs with sophisticated monitoring\\ndevices. If angioplasty is performed in the radiologydepartment’s angiographic suite, the patient may besedated for the procedure and a nurse will monitor thepatient’s vital signs during the procedure. If performedby a vascular surgeon, the angioplasty procedure will beperformed in an operating room or specially designedvascular procedure suite.\\nThe site of the introduction of the angioplasty equip-\\nment is prepared as a sterile surgical site. Although manyprocedures are performed by puncturing the vesselthrough skin, many procedures are also performed bysurgically exposing the site of entry. Direct view of thevessel’s puncture site aids in monitoring damage to thevessel or excessive bleeding at the site. Once the vessel ispunctured and the guidewire is introduced, fluoroscopyis used to monitor small injections of contrast media usedto visualize the path through the vessel. If the fluo-roscopy system has a feature called ‘roadmap’, theamount of contrast media injected will be greater in orderto define the full route the guidewire will take. The fluo-roscopy system will then superimpose subsequentimages over the roadmap while the vessel is traversed,that is, the physician moves the guidewire along the mapto the destination.\\nHaving reached the area of stenosis, the physician\\nwill inflate the balloon on the catheter that has been\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 201Angioplasty\\nBefore AfterAngioplasty\\nGuidewire\\nInadequate\\nflow\\nPlaqueLumenImproved\\nflowInflated\\nballoon\\nIn balloon angioplasty, plaque is pushed out of the clogged artery by the inflation of the balloon device.

Some commonly used ACE inhibitors arebenazepril (Lotensin), captopril (Capoten), enalapril(Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil,Zestril), moexipril (Univasc), perindopril (Aceon),quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and trandolapril(Mavik).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nACE inhibitor and the medical condition for which it isbeing taken. Check with the physician who prescribedthe drug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription forthe correct dosage.\\nThis medicine may take weeks to noticeably lower\\nblood pressure. Take it exactly as directed.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine without checking\\nwith the physician who prescribed it.\\nPrecautions\\nA person taking an ACE inhibitor should see a\\nphysician regularly. The physician will check the bloodpressure to make sure the medicine is working as itshould and will note any unwanted side effects. Peoplewho have high blood pressure often feel perfectly fine.However, they should continue to see their physicianseven when they feel well so that the physician can keepa close watch on their condition. It is also important forpatients to keep taking their medicine even when theyfeel fine.\\nACE inhibitors will not cure high blood pressure,\\nbut will help control the condition. To avoid the serioushealth problems that high blood pressure can cause,\\npatients may have to take medicine for the rest of theirlives. Furthermore, medicine alone may not be enough.Patients with high blood pressure may also need to avoidcertain foods, such as salty snacks, and keep their weightunder control. The health care professional who is treat-ing the condition can offer advice on what measures maybe necessary. Patients being treated for high blood pres-sure should not change their diets without consulting\\ntheir physicians.\\nAnyone taking this medicine for high blood pressure\\nshould not take any other prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medicine without first checking with hisor her physician. Some medicines, such as certain coldremedies, may increase blood pressure.\\nSome people feel dizzy or lightheaded after taking\\nthe first dose of an ACE inhibitor, especially if theyhave been taking a water pill (diuretic). Anyone whotakes these drugs should not drive, use machines or doanything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them. Such symptomsshould be reported to the physician or pharmacist ifthey do not subside within a day or so. For the first oneor two days of taking an ACE inhibitor, patients maybecome lightheaded when arising from bed in themorning. Patienst should rise slowly to a sitting posi-tion before standing up.\\nWhile a goal of treatment with an ACE inhibitor is to\\nlower the blood pressure, patients must be careful not tolet their blood pressure get too low. Low blood pressurecan lead to dizziness , lightheadedness and fainting . To\\nprevent the blood pressure from getting too low, observethese precautions:\\n• Do not drink alcohol without checking with the physi-\\ncian who prescribed this medicine.\\n• Captopril and moexipril should be taken one hour\\nbefore meals. Other ACE inhinbitors may be taken withor without meals.\\n• Avoid overheating when exercising or in hot weather.\\nThe loss of water from the body through heavy sweat-ing can cause low blood pressure.\\n• Check with a physician right away if illness occurs\\nwhile taking an ACE inhibitor. This is especially true ifthe illness involves severe nausea, vomiting, or diar-\\nrhea . V omiting and diarrhea can cause the loss of too\\nmuch water from the body, which can lead to low bloodpressure.\\nAnyone who is taking ACE inhibitors should be sure\\nto tell the health care professional in charge before hav-ing any surgical or dental procedures or receiving emer-gency treatment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 203Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitorsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 203'),\n",

Drugs that may cause decreased ACE levelsinclude ACE inhibitor antihypertensives and steroids.\\nDescription\\nACE plays an important role in the renin/aldosterone\\nmechanism which controls blood pressure by convertingangiotensin I to angiotensin II, two proteins involved inregulating blood pressure. Angiotensin I by itself is inac-tive, but when converted by ACE to the active form,angiotensin II, it causes narrowing of the small bloodvessels in tissues, resulting in an increase in blood pres-sure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the hormone aldos-terone, which causes an increase in blood pressure. Cer-tain kidney disorders increase the production ofangiotensin II, another cause of hypertension . Despite\\nthe action of ACE on blood pressure regulation, determi-nation of this enzyme is not very helpful in the evaluationof hypertension (high blood pressure).\\nPreparation\\nDetermination of ACE levels requires a blood sam-\\nple.

Flores\\nAnimal bite infections\\nDefinition\\nThe most common problem following an animal bite\\nis simple infection. The saliva of dogs and cats is knownto contain a wide variety of bacteria. According to onerecent study, bacteria or other pathogens show up inabout 85 percent of bites. When an animal bites, it canthen transmit pathogens into the wound. These microor-ganisms may grow within the wound and cause an infec-tion. The consequences of infection range from mild dis-comfort to life-threatening complications.\\nDescription\\nTwo to 4.5 million animal bites occur each year in\\nthe United States and about 1% of bites require hospital-ization. Animal bites result in 334,000 emergency roomvisits per year, which represents approximately 1% of allemergency hospital visits, at an annual cost of $100 mil-lion dollars in health care expenses and lost income.KEY TERMS\\nSarcoidosis —Sarcoidosis is a rare disease of\\nunknown cause in which inflammation occurs inlymph nodes and other tissues throughout thebody, usually the lungs, skin, liver, and eyes.Children are the most frequent victims of dog bites, with\\n5-9 year-old boys having the highest incidence. Men aremore often bitten by dogs than are women (3:1), whereaswomen are more often bitten by cats (3:1).\\nDog bites make up 80-85% of all reported incidents.\\nCats account for about 10% of reported bites, and otheranimals (including rodents, rabbits, horses, raccoons,bats, skunks, and monkeys) make up the remaining 5-10%. Cat bites become infected more frequently thandog bites. A dog’s mouth is rich in bacteria, but only 15-20% of dog bites become infected. In contrast, approxi-mately 30-50% of cat bites become infected.\\nMany factors contribute to the infection rates, such\\nas, for example, the type of wound inflicted, the locationof the wound, pre-existing health conditions in the bittenperson, the extent of delay before treatment, patient com-pliance and the presence of a foreign body in the wound.Dogs usually inflict crush injuries because they haverounded teeth and strong jaws; thus, the bite of an adultdog can exert up to 200 pounds per square inch of pres-sure. This pressure usually results in a crushing injury,causing damage to deep structures such as bones, bloodvessels, tendons, muscles, and nerves. Dog canine teethare also sharp and strong and also inflict lacerations.Cats, with their needle-like fangs, typically cause punc-ture wounds . Puncture wounds appear innocuous on the\\nsurface, but the underlying injury goes deep. Cat teethessentially inject bacteria into the bite, and the deep, nar-row wound is difficult to clean. Persons with impairedimmunocompetence—for example, individuals with HIVinfection—are especially vulnerable to infection.\\nThe bacterial species most commonly found in bite\\nwounds include Pasteurella multocida ,Staphylococcus\\naureus ,Pseudomonas sp , and Streptococcus sp . P . multoci-\\nda, the root cause of pasteurellosis, is especially prominent\\nin cat bite infections. Other infectious diseases from animalbites include cat-scratch disease ,tetanus and rabies .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common sign of infection from an animal\\nbite is inflammation. The skin around the wound is redand feels warm, and the wound may exude pus. Nearbylymph glands may be swollen. Complications can arise ifthe infection is not treated and spreads into deeper struc-tures or into the bloodstream. If the bite is deep or occurson the hand or at a joint, complications are more likely.\\nLive, disease-causing bacteria within the blood-\\nstream and tissues cause complications far from thewound site. Such complications include meningitis ,\\nbrain abscesses, pneumonia and lung abscesses, and\\nheart infections, among others. These complications canbe fatal. Deep bites or bites near joints can damage joints\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 206Animal bite infectionsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 206'),\n",

More than 80% of reported cases occurin persons under the age of 21. The disease is not nor-mally severe in individuals with healthy immune sys-tems. Symptoms may become serious, however, inimmunocompromised individuals, such as those withacquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) or those\\nundergoing chemotherapy . Common symptoms include\\nan inflamed sore in the area of the bite or scratch,swollen lymph nodes, fever ,fatigue , and rash.\\nRabies is caused by a virus that is transmitted through\\nthe bite of an animal that is already infected. More than90% of animal rabies cases occur in wild animals such asskunks, bats, and raccoons, with domestic animals such asdogs and cats accounting for less than 10%. The WorldHealth Organization (WHO) estimates that between35,000 and 50,000 individuals worldwide die each year asa result of rabies. The highest incidence of rabies occurs inAsia where, in 1997, over 33,000 deaths were noted, mostoccurring in India. Rabies is nowadays rare in the U.S. dueto good animal control practice. The delay of onset is usu-ally weeks to months after being bitten. Early symptomsof rabies include fever, headache , and flu-like symptoms.\\nThese progress to anxiety ,hallucinations , muscle\\nspasms, partial paralysis , fear of water (hydrophobia), and\\nother neurological symptoms as the virus spreads to thecentral nervous system. Medical treatment must be soughtsoon after exposure because death invariably follows once\\nthe infection becomes established.\\nDiagnosis\\nA medical examination involves taking the history of\\nthe injury and assessing the wound type and damage.Tetanus immunization and general health status arechecked. An x ray may be ordered to assess bone damageand to check for foreign objects in the wound. Wound\\ncultures are done for infected bites if the victim is at highrisk for complications or if the infection does not respondto treatment. Evaluation of possible exposure to rabies isalso important. A biting animal suspected of having rabiesis usually apprehended, tested, and observed for a periodof time for evidence of pre-existing infection.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the wound type, its site, and\\nrisk factors for infection. All wounds are cleaned and dis-infected as thoroughly as possible. Bites to the head and\\nface usually receive sutures, as do severe lacerationselsewhere. Puncture wounds are left open. If abscess for-\\nmation occurs, the physician may perform an incision soas to drain the abscess.\\nIf infection occurs, antibiotics are prescribed.\\nAntibiotics may also be used for infection prevention.Since a single bite wound may contain many differenttypes of bacteria, no single antibiotic is always effective.Commonly prescribed antibiotics are penicillin or a com-bination of amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium.\\nBecause rabies is caused by a virus, antibiotics are\\nnot effective.

It hasmany sensory nerves and is sensitive to pain . The rectum\\nis the last section of the digestive tract and has a mucuslayer as its inside surface. It has very few sensory nervesand is, therefore, relatively insensitive to pain. The analcanal has a ring of muscle, called the anal sphincter,which keeps the anus closed. There are a number of dif-ferent anorectal disorders.KEY TERMS\\nAnkylosing —When bones of a joint are fused,\\nstiff, or rigid.\\nHLA-B27 —An antigen or protein marker on cells\\nthat may indicate ankylosing spondylitis.\\nImmune suppressing —Anything that reduces the\\nactivity of the immune system.\\nInflammation —A reaction of tissues to disease or\\ninjury, often associated with pain and swelling.\\nSpondylitis —An inflammation of the spine.Causes and symptoms\\nHemorrhoids are swollen or varicose veins in the\\nanal canal and rectum. They may become inflamed,enlarged, or protrude from the anorectal area. Hemor-rhoids may bleed when passing a bowel movement. Theamount of bleeding is typically small. Frequently, hem-orrhoids develop because of straining during bowelmovements, especially if the person has constipation .\\nAn anal fissure is a tear in the lining of the anus that\\nis usually caused by a hard bowel movement. Fissuresare painful and bleed when the tissue is stressed duringbowel movements.\\nAnorectal abscesses are characterized by pus-form-\\ning infections in the anorectal region. Painful abscessesform under the skin.\\nAn anorectal fistula is an abnormal opening or chan-\\nnel from the anorectal area to another part of the body.Typically, the channel leads to pockets of skin near theanus. When seen in infants, anorectal fistulas are consid-ered birth defects . These are seen more frequently in\\nboys than in girls. Fistulas are also seen more frequentlyin people who have other diseases, including Crohn’s\\ndisease ,tuberculosis ,cancer , and diverticulitis. Anorec-\\ntal fistulas also occur following anorectal abscesses orother injury to the anal area. Fistulas are usually painfuland discharge pus.\\nProctitis is an inflammation of the internal mucosal\\nlining of the rectum. Ulcers of the lining may form anddevelop into ulcerative colitis .

The name comesfrom two Latin words that mean nervous inability to eat.In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia ner-vosa is usually marked by amenorrhea , or skipping at\\nleast three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth editionof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\\norders , or DSM-IV (1994), defines two subtypes of\\nanorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized bystrict dieting and exercise without binge eating; and a\\nbinge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com-pulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting andthe use of laxatives or enemas . DSM-IV defines a binge\\nas a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode ofcompulsive eating in which the individual consumes asignificantly larger amount of food than most peoplewould eat in similar circumstances.\\nDescription\\nAnorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a\\npsychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles-\\ncent females. Its incidence in the United States has dou-bled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported casesreflects a genuine increase in the number of personsaffected by the disorder, and not simply earlier or moreaccurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex-ia range between 0.5–1% of caucasian female adoles-cents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorderas of 1998 are female. It was originally thought that only5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is beingrevised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis-order is 14-18 years, although there are patients whodevelop anorexia as late as their 40s. In the 1970s and1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- andmiddle-class women, but that generalization is alsochanging. More recent studies indicate that anorexia isincreasingly common among women of all races andsocial classes in the United States.\\nAnorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem\\nnot only because of its rising incidence, but also becauseit has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatricdisorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious long-term health complications, including congestive heart\\nfailure , sudden death , growth retardation, dental prob-\\nlems, constipation , stomach rupture, swelling of the\\nsalivary glands, anemia and other abnormalities of theblood, loss of kidney function, and osteoporosis .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnorexia is a disorder that results from the interac-\\ntion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biologicalfactors. While the precise cause of the disease is notknown, it has been linked to the following:\\nSocial influences\\nThe rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect\\nthe present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper-class status as well as of female beauty. In addition, theincrease in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav-ior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi-tating other girls.\\nThe onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to\\na developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodiescoupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks.The increasing influence of the mass media in spreadingand reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted.\\nOccupational goals\\nThe risk of developing anorexia is higher among\\nadolescents preparing for careers that require attention toweight and/or appearance.

No singleexplanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has beeninterpreted as:\\n• A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection is\\nvariously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or asa desire to resemble men as closely as possible.\\n• A reaction to sexual abuse or assault.\\n• A desire to appear as fragile and nonthreatening as pos-\\nsible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female pas-sivity and weakness are attractive to men.\\n• Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and indepen-\\ndence. Some anorexics come from achievement-orient-ed families that stress physical fitness and dieting.\\nMany anorexics are perfectionistic and “driven” aboutschoolwork and other matters in addition to weightcontrol.\\n• Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a\\ndaughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction frommarital discord or other family tensions.\\n• Inability to interpret the body’s hunger signals accu-\\nrately due to early experiences of inappropriate feeding.\\nMale anorexics\\nAlthough anorexia nervosa is still considered a dis-\\norder that largely affects women, its incidence in themale population is rising. Less is known about the causesof anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the sameas for females. These include certain occupational goalsand increasing media emphasis on external appearance inmen. Moreover, homosexual males are under pressure toconform to an ideal body weight that is about 20 poundslighter than the standard “attractive” weight for hetero-sexual males.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a\\nnumber of factors. One is that the disorder varies some-what in severity from patient to patient. A second factoris denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor-der. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually\\nbrought to treatment by a family member.\\nMost anorexics are diagnosed by pediatricians or\\nfamily practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod-ies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low bloodpressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (fail-ure to menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdomi-nal pain , constipation, or lack of energy. The patient may\\nfeel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downybody hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may haveeroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the backof the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure-ment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IV specifies a\\nweight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal,with some allowance for body build and weight history.\\nThe doctor will need to rule out other physical condi-\\ntions that can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating,including metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especiallyhypothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of thedigestive tract, and a condition called superior mesentericartery syndrome. Persons with this condition sometimesvomit after meals because the blood supply to the intes-tine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood tests,an electrocardiogram, urinalysis , and bone densitometry\\n(bone density test ) in order to exclude other diseases and\\nto assess the patient’s nutritional status.\\nThe doctor will also need to distinguish between\\nanorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including depres-sion, schizophrenia , social phobia, obsessive-compulsive\\ndisorder , and body dysmorphic disorder. Two diagnostic\\ntests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes Test(EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of anorexia nervosa includes both short-\\nand long-term measures, and requires assessment bydietitians and psychiatrists as well as medical specialists.Therapy is often complicated by the patient’s resistanceor failure to carry out treatment plan.\\nHospital treatment\\nHospitalization is recommended for anorexics with\\nany of the following characteristics:\\n• weight of 40% or more below normal; or weight loss\\nover a three-month period of more than 30 pounds\\n• severely disturbed metabolism\\n• severe binging and purging• signs of psychosis\\n• severe depression or risk of suicide\\n• family in crisis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 212Anorectal disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 212'),\n",

An anascopy maybe performed to check for abnormal openings betweenthe anus and the skin, or anal fissures. The test is alsoused to diagnose rectal cancer .\\nPrecautions\\nAnoscopy should not be performed on patients with\\nacute cardiovascular problems due to the vasovagal reac-tion it may cause. This test is also not recommended forpatients with acute abdominal problems and those with aconstricted or narrowed anal canal.\\nDescription\\nAnoscopy views the anus and anal canal by using an\\nanoscope. An anoscope is a plastic, tube-shaped specu-lum that is a smaller version of a sigmoidscope. Beforethe anoscope is used, the doctor completes a digital rectalexamination with a lubricated, gloved index finger. Theanoscope is then lubricated and gently inserted a fewinches into the rectum. This procedure enlarges the rec-tum to allow the doctor to view the entire anal canal witha light. If any suspicious areas are noticed, a piece of tis-sue can be biopsied.\\nDuring the anoscopy procedure there may be a feel-\\ning of pressure or the need to go to the bathroom. If abiopsy is taken, the patient may feel a slight pinch. Theprocedure is performed on an out-patient basis, and takesapproximately an hour to complete.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient will be instructed to clear their rectum of\\nstool before the procedure.

Kapes\\nAnosmia\\nDefinition\\nThe term anosmia means lack of the sense of smell.\\nIt may also refer to a decreased sense of smell. Ageusia, acompanion word, refers to a lack of taste sensation.Patients who actually have anosmia may complainwrongly of ageusia, although they retain the ability todistinguish salt, sweet, sour, and bitter—humans’ onlytaste sensations.\\nDescription\\nOf the five senses, smell ranks fourth in importance\\nfor humans, although it is much more pronounced inother animals. Bloodhounds, for example, can smell anodor a thousand times weaker than humans. Taste, consid-ered the fifth sense, is mostly the smell of food in themouth. The sense of smell originates from the first cranialnerves (the olfactory nerves), which sit at the base of thebrain’s frontal lobes, right behind the eyes and above thenose. Inhaled airborne chemicals stimulate these nerves.\\nThere are other aberrations of smell beside a\\ndecrease. Smells can be distorted, intensified, or halluci-nated. These changes usually indicate a malfunction ofthe brain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of anosmia is nasal occlu-\\nsion caused by rhinitis (inflammation of the nasal mem-\\nbranes). If no air gets to the olfactory nerves, smell willnot happen. In turn, rhinitis and nasal polyps (growths\\non nasal membranes) are caused by irritants such asallergens, infections, cigarette smoke, and other air pol-lutants. Tumors such as nasal polyps can also block thenasal passages and the olfactory nerves and cause anos-mia. Head injury or, rarely, certain viral infections can\\ndamage or destroy the olfactory nerves.Diagnosis\\nIt is difficult to measure a loss of smell, and no one\\ncomplains of loss of smell in just one nostril. So a physi-cian usually begins by testing each nostril separatelywith a common, non-irritating odor such as perfume,lemon, vanilla, or coffee. Polyps and rhinitis are obviouscausal agents a physician looks for. Imaging studies ofthe head may be necessary in order to detect brain injury,sinus infection, or tumor.\\nTreatment\\nCessation of smoking is the first step. Many smok-\\ners who quit discover new tastes so enthusiastically thatthey immediately gain weight. Attention to reducingexposure to other nasal irritants and treatment of respira-tory allergies or chronic upper respiratory infections will\\nbe beneficial. Corticosteroids are particularly helpful.\\nAlternative treatment\\nFinding and treating the cause of the loss of smell is\\nthe first approach in naturopathic medicine . If rhinitis\\nis the cause, treating acute rhinitis with herbal mast cellstabilizers and herbal decongestants can offer some\\nrelief as the body heals. If chronic rhinitis is present, thisis often related to an environmental irritant or to foodallergies. Removal of the causative factors is the first stepto healing. Nasal steams with essential oils offer relief ofthe blockage and tonification of the membranes. Block-ages can sometimes be resolved through naso-specifictherapy—a way of realigning the nasal cavities. Polypblockage can be addressed through botanical medicinetreatment as well as hydrotherapy . Olfactory nerve\\ndamage may not be regenerable. Some olfactory aberra-tions, like intensified sense of smell, can be resolvedusing homeopathic medicine.\\nPrognosis\\nIf nasal inflammation is the cause of anosmia, the\\nchances of recovery are excellent. However, if nervedamage is the cause of the problem, the recovery of smellis much more difficult.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBennett, J. Claude, and Fred Plum, eds. Cecil Textbook of Med-\\nicine.

If the condition does not involve totaloxygen deprivation, it is often called hypoxia, althoughthe two terms have been used interchangeably. A relatedcondition, anoxemia, occurs when the blood circulatesbut contains a below normal amount of oxygen.\\nThe five types of anoxia or hypoxia include hypox-\\nemic, anemic, affinity, stagnant, and histotoxic. Hypox-emic anoxia happens when the oxygen pressure outsidethe body is so low that the hemoglobin, the chemicalwhich carries oxygen in the red blood cells (RBCs), isunable to become fully loaded with the gas. This results intoo little oxygen reaching the tissues and can occur in suf-focation when a person is at high altitude, where the pres-sure of oxygen in the air is much less than at sea level.\\nAnemic anoxia results from a decrease in the\\namount of hemoglobin or RBCs in the blood, whichreduces the ability to get oxygen to the tissues. Anemiamay result from lack of production of red blood cellsKEY TERMS\\nAllergen —Any substance that irritates only those\\nwho are sensitive (allergic) to it.\\nCorticosteroids —Cortisone, prednisone, and\\nrelated drugs that reduce inflammation.\\nRhinitis —Inflammation and swelling of the nasal\\nmembranes.\\nNasal polyps —Drop-shaped overgrowths of the\\nnasal membranes.(iron deficiency), blood loss (hemorrhage), or shortened\\nlifespan of red blood cells (autoimmune disease).\\nAffinity anoxia involves a defect in the chemistry of\\nthe blood such that the hemoglobin can no longer pick upas much oxygen from the air, even though the quantitiesare normal, reducing how much is delivered to the tissues.\\nStagnant anoxia occurs when there is interference\\nwith the blood flow, although the blood and its oxygen-carrying abilities are normal. A common cause of generalstagnant anoxia is heart disease or interference with thereturn of blood flow through the veins. Examples of localstagnant anoxia include exposure to cold, diseases thatrestrict circulation to the extremities, and ergot poison-\\ning. When the tissue or organ itself has a reduced ability\\nto accept and use the oxygen, it is called histotoxic anox-ia. The classic example is cyanide poisoning, where thechemical inactivates a cellular enzyme necessary for thecell to use oxygen. Thus, tissue exposed to cyanide can-not use the oxygen even though it is in normal amountsin the bloodstream. Histotoxic anoxia can also be causedby exposure to narcotics, alcohol, formaldehyde, ace-tone, toluene, and certain anesthetic agents.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnoxia and hypoxia can be caused by any number of\\ndisease states of the blood, lungs, heart and circulationincluding heart attack , severe asthma , or emphysema .\\nIt can also result from smoke or carbon monoxide inhala-tion, improper exposure to anesthesia, poisoning, strangu-lation, near-drowning , or high altitude exposure through\\nmountain climbing or travel in an insufficiently pressur-ized airplane. Anoxia, and the resultant brain damage, is aparticular problem with newborns during difficult births.\\nNo matter what the cause of anoxia, the symptoms\\nare similar. In severe cases, the patient is often confusedand commonly stuperous or comatose (in a state ofunconsciousness). Depending on the severity of the injuryto the brain, the organ most sensitive to reduced oxygenintake, this condition can persist for hours, days, weeks,or even months or years. Seizures, myoclonic jerks (invol-untary muscle spasms or twitches), and neck stiffness aresome other symptoms of the anoxic condition.\\nSymptoms of more localized or less complete oxygen\\ndeprivation (hypoxia) include increased breathing rate,lightheadedness, dizziness , tingling or warm sensation,\\nsweating, reduced field of vision, sleepiness, a bluish tintto skin, particularly the fingertips and lips, and behaviorchanges, often an inappropriate sense of euphoria.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anoxia and hypoxia is commonly made\\nthrough the appearance of clinical symptoms.

The exact test that isperformed is dependent on the suspected cause of theanoxia. One systemic measure of tissue anoxia is theserum lactate (lactic acid) test. When cells are forced toproduce energy without oxygen, as would happen duringanoxia, lactic acid is one of the byproducts. Thus, anincrease in lactic acid in the blood would indicate that tis-sues were starved for oxygen and are using non-oxygenpathways to produce energy. Normally, the blood con-tains less than 2mmol/L of lactic acid. However, someforms of anoxia do not increase lactic acid concentrationsin the blood and some increases in lactic acid levels arenot associated with anoxia, so an elevated value for thistest is only suggestive of an anoxic or hypoxic condition.\\nTreatment\\nThe exact treatment for anoxia is dependent on the\\ncause of the reduced oxygen reaching the tissues. How-ever, immediate restoration of tissue oxygen levelsthrough supplementing the patient’s air supply with100% oxygen is a common first step. Secondary stepsoften include support of the cardiovascular systemthrough drugs or other treatment, treatment of lung dis-ease, transfusions, or administration of anecdotes for poi-soning, as appropriate.\\nPrognosis\\nA good prognosis is dependent on the ability to treat\\nthe underlying cause of the low oxygen levels. If cardio-vascular and respiratory systems can be supported ade-quately, recovery from the injury to the tissue is possible,although extent of injury to the brain can be difficult toassess. The exact amount of recovery varies with theamount of injury sustained, where significant injury bringsa poorer prognosis. As recovery occurs, both psychologi-cal and neurological abnormalities may appear, persist,and can improve. Some problems seen after anoxiainclude mental confusion, personality changes, amnesia\\nor other types of memory loss, hallucinations , and persis-\\ntent myoclonus (involuntary contractions of the muscles).\\nPrevention\\nHypoxemic anoxia can be avoided by utilizing sup-\\nplemental oxygen when in high altitudes and beingaware of the early symptoms of altitude sickness and\\nreducing altitude once recognized.

Antacids should notbe confused with gastric acid inhibitors, such as the H-2receptor blockers (cimetidine, ranitide and others) or theproton pump inhibitors (lansoprazole, omeprazole andothers). Although all three classes of drugs act to reducethe levels of gastric acid, their mechanisms are different,and this affects the appropriate use of the drug. Antacidshave a rapid onset and short duration of action, and aremost appropriate for rapid relief of gastric discomfort fora short period of time.\\nAntacids may be divided into two classes, those that\\nwork by chemical neutralization of gastric acid, mostnotably sodium bicarbonate; and those that act byadsorption of the acid (non-absorbable antacids), such ascalcium and magnesium salts.\\nThe chemical antacids show the most rapid onset of\\naction, but may cause “acid rebound,” a condition inwhich the gastric acid returns in greater concentrationafter the drug effect has stopped. Also, since theseantacids may contain high concentrations of sodium,they may be inappropriate in patients with hypertension .\\nCalcium and magnesium salts act by adsorption of\\nthe acid, and are less prone to the rebound effect, butmay have other significant disadvantages. Theseantacids are particularly prone to drug interactions, andpatients taking other medications must often avoidsimultaneous administration of the medications. Theseantacids are more effective in liquid formulations thanin tablet or capsule form, and so may be inconvenientfor routine dosing.\\nThe non-absorbable antacids may have additional\\nuses beyond control of hyperacidity. Calcium salts maybe used as diet supplements in prevention of osteoporo-\\nsis. Aluminum carbonate is useful for binding phosphate,\\nand has been effective in treatment and control of hyper-phosphatemia or for use with a low phosphate diet to pre-vent formation of phosphate urinary stones. This applica-tion is particularly valuable in patients with chronic renalfailure. Antacids with aluminum and magnesium hydrox-ides or aluminum hydroxide alone effectively preventsignificant stress ulcer bleeding in post-operative\\npatients or those with severe burns .\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dose depends on the type of antacid. Consult\\nspecific references.\\nWhen using antacids in chewable tablet form, chew\\nthe tablet well before swallowing. Drink a glass of waterafter taking chewable aluminum hydroxide. Lozengesshould be allowed to dissolve completely in the mouth.\\nLiquid antacids should be shaken well before using.\\nPrecautions\\nAntacids should be avoided if any signs of appen-\\ndicitis or inflamed bowel are present. These include\\ncramping, pain , and soreness in the lower abdomen,\\nbloating, and nausea and vomiting .\\nAntacids may affect the results of some medical\\ntests, such as those that measure how much acid thestomach produces. Health care providers and patientsshould keep this in mind when scheduling a medical test.\\nAntacids that contain magnesium may cause diar-\\nrhea . Other types of antacids may cause constipation .\\nAvoid taking antacids containing sodium bicarbon-\\nate when the stomach is uncomfortably full from eatingor drinking.\\nAntacids should not be given to children under six\\nyears of age.\\nAntacids that contain calcium or sodium bicarbonate\\nmay cause side effects, such as dizziness , nausea, and\\nvomiting, in people who consume large amounts of calci-um (from dairy products or calcium supplements). Insome cases, this can lead to permanent kidney damage.Before combining antacids with extra calcium, checkwith a physician.\\nSome antacids contain large amounts of sodium,\\nparticularly sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Anyonewho is on a low-sodium diet should check the list ofingredients or check with a physician or pharmacistbefore taking an antacid product.\\nExcessive use of antacids may cause or increase the\\nseverity or kidney problems. Calcium based antacidsmay lead to renal stone formation.\\nALLERGIES.

Later, the focus shifts to checking onfetal well-being with a variety of technological toolssuch as ultrasound scans. Descriptions of the most com-mon tests and procedures used during pregnancy are\\nlisted below.\\nWhen a woman first learns she is pregnant, her\\nphysician will run a series of routine urine and bloodtests to determine her blood type, check for anemia andgestational diabetes , make sure she is immune to rubel-\\nla(German measles ) and check for infectious diseases\\nlike HIV , hepatitis, chlamydia or syphilis .

The procedure takes a few minutes, is pain-less and usually is covered by health insurance.\\nThe ultrasound technician will ask the pregnant\\nwoman to remove her clothes and change into a gown.The technician may rub some gel on the woman’s stom-ach, which helps the hand-held device pick up sound\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 219Antenatal testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 219'),\n",

In certain cases, the technician may insert a\\nplastic probe into the woman’s vaginal canal to get aclearer picture of the fetus. Early in pregnancy, the testmay need to be done with a full bladder.\\nUnlike x rays, ultrasound is safe to use during preg-\\nnancy. It does not cause any known side-effects thatwould harm the mother or baby.\\nPregnant women usually will have their first ultra-\\nsound anytime between 8 and 12 weeks of gestation. Innormal cases, the technician is able to identify a fetalheartbeat, which appears as a flashing light on the screen.Closer to the due date, physicians use ultrasound to makesure the fetus is in the correct position to exit the birthcanal head first.\\nSometimes an ultrasound will show that a fetus has\\nstopped growing, or a gestational sac has formed withouta fetus, and a miscarriage has occurred. Later in pregnan-cy, it also may show that the child is in a breech position,oriented feet first, which can cause a difficult labor.\\nTests for birth defects\\nMost obstetricians offer parents a variety of ways to\\nfind out if their developing child might have birth\\ndefects such as spina bifida and Down Syndrome . An\\nalpha fetoprotein screen can be done through a simpleblood test in the doctor’s office between the 16th and18th week of gestation. It tells the odds that their childwill have a severe congenital anomaly. The test works bymeasuring the level of alpha fetoprotein, a substance pro-duced by a fetus with birth defects. Low levels of alphafetoprotein in the mother’s blood may indicate Down’sSyndrome. In that case, the next step for most couples isamniocentesis because the alpha fetoprotein test can\\ngive false-positive results. Amniocentesis is a more accu-rate test, but it also has higher risks of complications.\\nThis procedure typically is used to diagnose Down\\nsyndrome while a developing child is still in the womb,at 15-28 weeks.\\nDuring amniocentesis, a doctor inserts a needle\\nthrough a woman’s vaginal canal and inside her cervix.Using ultrasound as a guide, the doctor pierces the uterusto withdraw a sample of fluid from the amniotic sac.Afterwards, tiny cells shed by the fetus can be studied inthe laboratory. Scientists can analyze DNA samples todetermine if the fetus has Down syndrome or othergenetic conditions. Amniocentesis also can determine thesex of the fetus.\\nWomen who have a history of recurring miscar-\\nriages may not want to have this procedure.\\nAmniocentesis is usually performed in a doctor’s\\noffice on an outpatient basis.Common side effects include cramping and bleeding.\\nIn about one out of every 1,000 cases, amniocentesis\\ncauses a needle to puncture the uterine wall, which couldresult in miscarriage.\\nIn most cases, couples find out their baby does not\\nhave a birth defect.\\nIf the results come back positive for Down’s Syn-\\ndrome or other serious conditions, the couple mustdecide if they want to end the pregnancy. Others use theknowledge to plan and prepare any special care neededfor their future child.\\nGroup B Strep\\nThis test is for Group B streptococci (GBS) infection.\\nBy testing for GBS, physicians can determine if a\\nwoman is at risk of passing this infection along to her child.\\nWomen who have had a prior child with GBS, or\\nwho have a fever or prolonged or premature rupture of\\nthe amniotic sac may be at higher risk for this type ofinfection.\\nGBS is a type of bacteria commonly found in the\\nvagina and rectum. Unlike regular strep throat , GBS\\ncan be present in a person’s body without causing anysymptoms, so many women do not realize they areinfected with it.\\nTo test for the presence of GBS, doctors may take a\\nurine sample. They also may collect samples from thevagina or rectum, which are then analyzed in a lab. Thistest is usually performed late in pregnancy, at 35-37weeks of gestation.\\nThis is a routine urine test or pelvic exam with no\\nside effects.\\nIn many cases, doctors do not find any evidence of\\nthis type of infection.\\nIf a woman is found to be infected with Group B\\nstrep, physicians usually wait to treat it until just beforelabor begins. At that time, they may give the motherantibiotics so the baby is not born with the infection.\\nNewborns who are exposed to Group B strep can haveinflammation of the brain, spinal cord, blood or lungs.In some cases, this serious complication can result ininfant death .\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEisenberg, Arlene, et al.

In some cases,it can result in infant deathwarned of any problems that may necessitate further test-\\ning or immediate delivery. The results reflect the adequa-cy of blood flow (and oxygen delivery) to the fetus fromthe placenta.\\nAntepartum tests are usually done in pregnancies at\\nhigh risk for fetal complications. Various reasonsinclude:\\n• any chronic illness in the mother, such as high blood\\npressure or diabetes\\n• problems with previous pregnancies, such as stillbirth\\n• fetal complications, such as intrauterine growth retar-\\ndation (a slowing of growth of the fetus) or birth defects\\n• problems in the current pregnancy, including pre-\\neclampsia (serious pregnancy-induced high blood pres-sure), gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, prema-ture rupture of the membranes, excessive amniotic fluid(the liquid that surrounds the fetus), vaginal bleeding,or placenta previa (a condition in which the placenta is\\npositioned over the cervix instead of near the top of theuterus)\\n• twins or other multiple fetuses\\nOne of the most common indications for antepartum\\ntesting is post-term pregnancy. A pregnancy should notbe allowed to continue past 42 weeks. (The usual preg-nancy is 40 weeks in duration). Babies should be moni-tored with antepartum testing starting at 41 weeks. After41 weeks, there is an increasing risk that the placentacannot meet the growing baby’s needs for oxygen andnutrition . This may be reflected in decreased move-\\nments of the baby, decreased amniotic fluid, and changesin the heart rate pattern of the baby.\\nDescription\\nTechnology\\nThe NST and CST use a technique called electronic\\nfetal monitoring to evaluate the heartbeat of the fetus.\\nThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound examination.\\nNST\\nThe NST is usually the first antepartum test used to\\nverify fetal well-being. It is based on the principle thatwhen the fetus moves, its heartbeat normally speeds up.The NST assesses fetal health through monitoring accel-erations of the heart rate in response to the baby’s ownmovements, i.e., in the absence of stress .\\nThe mother lays down or sits, and an electronic fetal\\nmonitor is placed on her abdomen to monitor the fetalheart rate. The doctor records the baby’s heartbeat on agraph or “tracing” to determine whether it demonstrates\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 221Antepartum testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 221'),\n",

To\\nrecord fetal movements on the tracing, the mother press-es a button every time she feels the baby move. If thebaby is inactive, the mother may be asked to rub herabdomen to “awaken” it. Sometimes an instrument isused to produce a loud noise to arouse the fetus (vibroa-coustic stimulation). The test usually takes between20–45 minutes.\\nA baby who is receiving enough oxygen should\\nmove at least twice in a 20 minute period. The baby’sheart rate should increase at least 20 beats per minute forat least 20 seconds during these movements. The NST isthe simplest and cheapest antepartum test.\\nBiophysical profile\\nThe biophysical profile is an ultrasound exam that\\ncan add additional information to the NST. During thebiophysical profile, the examiner checks for variouscharacteristics of the baby to evaluate its overall health.These include: fetal movement, fetal tone, breathingmovements, and the amniotic fluid volume. Amnioticfluid volume is important because a decreased amountraises the possibility that the baby may be under stress.The five components of the test (NST is also included)are each given a score of 2 for normal (or present), 1 ifdecreased, and 0 for abnormal. The highest possiblescore is 10. The “modified” biophysical profile isanother option; this includes only the NST and amnioticfluid volume.\\nCST\\nThe CST is like the NST, except that the fetus is\\nevaluated in response to contractions of the mother’suterus. Because it is a more complicated test, it is oftenused after an abnormal NST to confirm the results. Uter-ine contractions produce “stress” in the fetus becausethey temporarily stop the flow of blood and oxygen. TheCST is used to confirm that the fetus does not respond tothis stress by a decrease in the heart rate.\\nThe CST is performed with the same equipment as\\nthe NST. Maternal blood pressure and fetal heart rate arerecorded along with the onset, relative intensity, andduration of any spontaneous contractions. For an accu-rate test, the contractions should be of sufficient durationand frequency. If uterine activity does not occur natural-ly, a drug called oxytocin may be given to the motherintravenously (hence the test’s alternate name, the oxy-tocin challenge test) to provoke contractions. Anotheroption is self-stimulation of the mother’s nipples,because this releases natural oxytocin. The fetal heartrate is observed until, ideally, three moderate contrac-tions occur within 10 minutes.Preparation\\nThe mother should eat just before the antepartum\\ntests to help stimulate fetal activity.\\nRisks\\nThere are no appreciable risks from the NST or the\\nbiophysical profile. Ultrasound used for the biophysicalprofile is painless and safe because it uses no harmfulradiation, and no evidence has been found that soundwaves cause any adverse effects on the mother or fetus.\\nThe frequency of antepartum testing depends on the\\nreason for its use. All of the tests occasionally give incor-rect results, which may prompt an unnecessary earlydelivery or cesarean. Repeat testing is important to dou-ble-check any abnormal findings.\\nNormal results\\nIn general, “negative” or normal results on antepar-\\ntum testing provide reassurance that the baby is healthyand should remain so for perhaps a week, with no needfor immediate delivery. Unfortunately, the tests cannotguarantee that there are no problems, because falselynormal results can occur, though this is unusual. Even ifall test results are normal, it is important to realize thatthis does not guarantee a “perfect” baby.\\nThe NST is normal (“reactive”) if two or more dis-\\ntinct fetal movements occur in association with appropri-ate accelerations of the fetal heart rate within 20 minutes.A biophysical profile score of 8-10 is considered reassur-ing. The CST is normal if the fetus shows no decelera-tions in heart rate in response to three uterine contrac-tions within 10 minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA “positive” result suggests that the baby is not\\nreceiving enough oxygen for some reason. However, it isquite possible that the test result was falsely abnormal.To confirm or monitor a suspected disorder, follow-uptesting with the same or an alternate test will probably beperformed at least weekly.\\nThe NST is abnormal (“nonreactive”) if the fetal\\nheart rate fails to speed up by at least 20 beats per minuteat least two times during a 20-minute period. Abnormaldecreases in the heart rate (decelerations) are also a causefor concern.\\nA biophysical profile score of 6 is considered a\\ncause for concern and should be followed by further test-ing. Scores of 4 or less may require immediate deliveryof the fetus.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 222Antepartum testingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 222'),\n",

In humans, the infection can often betreated, but it is almost always fatal in animals.\\nDescription\\nAnthrax is most often found in the agricultural\\nareas of South and Central America, southern and east-ern Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and the MiddleEast. In the United States, anthrax is rarely reported,however, cases of animal infection with anthrax aremost often reported in Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi,Oklahoma, and South Dakota. The bacterium and itsassociated disease get their name from the Greek wordmeaning “coal” because of the characteristic coal-blacksore that is the hallmark of the most common form ofthe disease.\\nDuring the 1800s, in England and Germany, anthrax\\nwas known either as “wool-sorter’s” or “ragpicker’s” dis-ease because workers contracted the disease from bacter-ial spores present on hides and in wool or fabric fibers.Spores are the small, thick-walled dormant stage of somebacteria that enable them to survive for long periods oftime under adverse conditions. The first anthrax vaccinewas perfected in 1881 by Louis Pasteur.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 223AnthraxGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 223'),\n",

Four of the five patientswith the pulmonary form of the disease died. Other casesappeared in the 1970s when contaminated goatskindrumheads from Haiti were brought into this country assouvenirs. Today, anthrax is rare, even among cattle,largely because of widespread animal vaccination . How-\\never, some serious epidemics continue to occur amonganimal herds and in human settlements in developingcountries due to ineffective control programs.\\nThere has been a great deal of recent concern that\\nthe bacteria that causes anthrax may be used by somecountries as a type of biological warfare, since it is possi-ble to become infected simply by breathing in the spores.The largest-ever documented outbreak of human anthraxcontracted through spore inhalation occurred in Russia in1979, when anthrax spores were released from a militarylaboratory, causing a regional epidemic that killed 69 ofits 77 victims. Because the United States governmentconsiders anthrax to be of potential risk to soldiers, theDepartment of Defense has begun systematic vaccinationof all military personnel against anthrax, and othernations, such as Britain, are rapidly following suit.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnthrax is caused by the bacterium Bacillus\\nanthracis , which produces spores that can remain dor-\\nmant for years in soil and on animal products, such ashides, wool, hair, or bones. The disease is often fatal tocattle, sheep, and goats, and their hides, wool, and bonesare often heavily contaminated.\\nToday, in humans, the disease is almost always an\\noccupational hazard, contracted by those who handleanimal hides (farmers, butchers, and veterinarians) or\\nsort wool. It is also possible to become infected withanthrax by eating meat from contaminated animals.There are no reports of the disease spreading from oneperson to another.\\nSymptoms vary depending on how the disease was\\ncontracted, but the symptoms usually appear within oneweek of exposure.\\nCutaneous anthrax\\nIn humans, anthrax usually occurs when the bacteria\\nenter a cut or abrasion, causing a skin (cutaneous) infec-tion at the site. Cutaneous anthrax, as this infection iscalled, is the mildest form of the disease. At first, thebacteria cause an itchy, raised area like an insect bite.Within one to two days, inflammation occurs around theraised area, and a blister forms around an area of dyingtissue that becomes black in the center. Other symptomsmay include shivering and chills. In most cases the bacte-ria remain within the sore. If, however, they spread to thenearest lymph node (or, in rare cases, escape into thebloodstream), the bacteria can cause a form of blood poi-\\nsoning that rapidly proves fatal.\\nInhalation anthrax\\nInhaling the bacteria or bacterial spores can lead to a\\nrare, fatal form of anthrax known as pulmonary orinhalation anthrax that attacks the lungs and sometimesspreads to the brain. Inhalation anthrax begins with flu-like symptoms, namely fever ,fatigue ,headache , and\\nshortness of breath , but progresses to bronchitis , dur-\\ning which time it becomes difficult to breathe, and final-ly, the patient enters a state of shock . This rare form of\\nanthrax is usually fatal, even if treated within one or twodays after the symptoms appear.\\nIntestinal anthrax\\nIntestinal anthrax is a rare, often-fatal form of the dis-\\nease, caused by eating meat from an animal that died ofanthrax. Intestinal anthrax causes stomach and intestinalinflammation and sores or lesions (ulcers), much like thesores that appear on the skin in the cutaneous form ofanthrax. The first signs of the disease are nausea and\\nvomiting , loss of appetite, and fever, followed by abdomi-\\nnal pain, vomiting of blood, and severe bloody diarrhea .\\nDiagnosis\\nAnthrax is diagnosed by detecting B. anthracis in\\nsamples taken from blood, skin lesions , or respiratory\\nsecretions.

Additional DNA-based tests are alsocurrently being perfected.\\nTreatment\\nIn the early stages, anthrax is curable by administering\\nhigh doses of penicillin, but in the advanced stages, it canbe fatal. Other commonly used antibiotics , such as ery-\\nthromycin, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol, are also effec-tive, particularly for those individuals who are allergic topenicillin.

Ten to twenty percent ofpatients will die from anthrax of the skin (cutaneousanthrax) if it is not properly treated. All patients withinhalation (pulmonary) anthrax will die if untreated.Intestinal anthrax is fatal 25-75% of the time.\\nPrevention\\nAnthrax is relatively rare in the United States\\nbecause of widespread animal vaccination and practicesused to disinfect hides or other animal products. Forthose in high-risk professions, an anthrax vaccine isavailable that is 93% effective in protecting against infec-tion. To provide this immunity, an individual must begiven an initial course of three injections, given twoweeks apart, followed by booster injections at 6, 12, and18 months and an annual immunization thereafter.\\nApproximately 30% of those who have been vacci-\\nnated against anthrax may notice mild local reactions,such as a slight tenderness at the injection site. Someonewho has already had anthrax might have a more severelocal reaction upon vaccination. Infrequently, there maybe a severe local reaction with extensive swelling of theforearm, and only a very few vaccine recipients mayhave a more general flu-like reaction to the shot.\\nOther means of preventing the spread of infection\\ninclude carefully handling dead animals suspected ofhaving the disease and providing good ventilation whenprocessing hides, fur, wool, or hair.

Turkington\\nAntiacne drugs\\nDefinition\\nAntiacne drugs are medicines that help clear up pim-\\nples, blackheads, whiteheads, and more severe forms ofacne .\\nPurpose\\nDifferent types of antiacne drugs are used for differ-\\nent purposes. For example, lotions, soaps, gels, andcreams containing benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin may beused to clear up mild to moderately severe acne.Isotretinoin (Accutane) is prescribed only for verysevere, disfiguring acne.\\nAcne is a skin condition that occurs when pores or\\nhair follicles become blocked. This allows a waxymaterial, sebum, to collect inside the pores or follicles.Normally, sebum flows out onto the skin and hair toform a protective coating, but when it cannot get out,small swellings develop on the skin surface. Bacteriaand dead skin cells can also collect that can causeinflammation. Swellings that are small and notinflamed are whiteheads or blackheads. When theybecome inflamed, they turn into pimples. Pimples thatfill with pus are called pustules.\\nAcne cannot be cured, but acne drugs can help clear\\nthe skin. Benzoyl peroxide and tretinoin work by mildlyirritating the skin. This encourages skin cells to sloughoff, which helps open blocked pores. Benzoyl peroxidealso kills bacteria, which helps prevent whiteheads andblackheads from turning into pimples. Isotretinoinshrinks the glands that produce sebum.Description\\nBenzoyl peroxide is found in many over-the-counter\\nacne products that are applied to the skin, such asBenoxyl, Clear By Design, Neutrogena Acne, PanOxyl,and some formulations of Clean & Clear, Clearasil, andOxy. Some benzoyl peroxide products are available with-out a physician’s prescription; others require a prescrip-tion. Tretinoin (Retin-A) is available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and comes in liquid, cream, and gelforms, which are applied to the skin. Isotretinoin (Accu-tane), which is taken by mouth in capsule form, is avail-able only with a physician’s prescription. Only physicianswho have experience in diagnosing and treating severeacne, such as dermatologists, should prescribe isotretinoin.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanti-acne drug. These drugs usually come with writtendirections for patients and should be used only as direct-ed. Patients who have questions about how to use themedicine should check with a physician or pharmacist.\\nPatients who use isotretinoin usually take the medi-\\ncine for a few months, then stop for at least two months.Their acne may continue to improve even after they stoptaking the medicine. If the condition is still severe afterseveral months of treatment and a two-month break, thephysician may prescribe a second course of treatment.\\nPrecautions\\nIsotretinoin\\nIsotretinoin can cause serious birth defects , includ-\\ning mental retardation and physical deformities. This\\nmedicine should not be used during pregnancy . Women\\nwho are able to bear children should not use isotretinoinunless they have very severe acne that has not cleared upwith the use of other anti-acne drugs. In that case, awoman who uses this drug must have a pregnancy testtwo weeks before beginning treatment and each monththey are taking the drug. Another pregnancy test must bedone one month after treatment ends. The woman mustuse an effective birth control method for one monthbefore treatment begins and must continue using itthroughout treatment and for one month after treatmentends. Women who are able to bear children and who wantto use this medicine should discuss this information withtheir health care providers. Before using the medicine,they will be asked to sign a consent form stating that theyunderstand the danger of taking isotretinoin during preg-nancy and that they agree to use effective birth control.\\nDo not donate blood to a blood bank while taking\\nisotretinoin or for 30 days after treatment with the drug\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 226Antiacne drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 226'),\n",

If this happens, do not drive or do anything elsethat could be dangerous until vision returns to normal.Let the physician know about the problem.\\nThis medicine may also make the eyes, nose, and\\nmouth dry. Ask the physician about using special eyedrops to relieve eye dryness. To temporarily relieve thedry mouth , chew sugarless gum, suck on sugarless\\ncandy or ice chips, or use saliva substitutes, which comein liquid and tablet forms and are available without a pre-scription.

Mouth drynessthat continues over a long time may contribute to tooth\\ndecay and other dental problems.\\nIsotretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight.\\nPatients being treated with this medicine should avoidexposure to the sun and should not use tanning beds, tan-ning booths, or sunlamps until they know how the drugaffects them.\\nIn the early stages of treatment with isotretinoin,\\nsome people’s acne seems to get worse before it startsgetting better. If the condition becomes much worse or ifthe skin is very irritated, check with the physician whoprescribed the medicine.\\nBenzoyl peroxide and tretinoin\\nWhen applying antiacne drugs to the skin, be careful\\nnot to get the medicine in the eyes, mouth, or inside ofthe nose. Do not put the medicine on skin that is windburned, sunburned, or irritated, and do not apply it toopen wounds .\\nBecause antiacne drugs such as benzoyl peroxide\\nand tretinoin irritate the skin slightly, avoid doing any-thing that might cause further irritation. Wash the facewith mild soap and water only two or three times a day,unless the physician says to wash it more often. Avoidusing abrasive soaps or cleansers and products that mightdry the skin or make it peel, such as medicated cosmet-\\nics, cleansers that contain alcohol, or other acne productsthat contain resorcinol, sulfur or salicylic acid.\\nIf benzoyl peroxide or tretinoin make the skin too\\nred or too dry or cause too much peeling, check with aphysician. Using the medicine less often or using aweaker strength may be necessary.\\nTretinoin may increase sensitivity to sunlight. While\\nbeing treated with this medicine, avoid exposure to the sunand do not use tanning beds, tanning booths, or sunlamps.If it is not possible to avoid being in the sun, use a sun-screen with a skin protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 orwear protective clothing over the treated areas. The skinmay also become more sensitive to cold and wind. Peoplewho use this medicine should protect their skin from coldand wind until they know how the medicine affects them.\\nBenzoyl peroxide may discolor hair or colored fab-\\nrics.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople who have certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines may have problems if theyuse antiacne drugs.

Byrelaxing the blood vessels, antiangina drugs reduce theheart’s work load and increase the amount of oxygen-rich blood that reaches the heart. These drugs come indifferent forms, and are used in three main ways:\\n• taken regularly over a long period, they reduce the\\nnumber of angina attacks.\\n• taken just before some activity that usually brings on an\\nattack, such as climbing stairs, they prevent attacks.\\n• taken when an attack begins, they relieve the pain and\\npressure.\\nNot every form of antiangina drug can be used in\\nevery way. Some work too slowly to prevent attacks thatare about to begin or to relieve attacks that have alreadystarted. These forms can be used only to reduce the num-ber of attacks. Be sure to understand how and when touse the type of antiangina drug that has been prescribed.\\nDescription\\nAntiangina drugs, also known as nitrates, come in\\nmany different forms: tablets and capsules that are swal-lowed; tablets that are held under the tongue, inside thelip, or in the cheek until they dissolve; stick-on patches;ointment; and in-the-mouth sprays. Commonly usedantiangina drugs include isosorbide dinitrate (Isordil,Sorbitrate, and other brands) and nitroglycerin (Nitro-Bid, Nitro-Dur, Nitrolingual Spray, Nitrostat Tablets,Transderm-Nitro, and other brands).

The patient experiences marked or persistent\\nfear of one or more social or performance situations inwhich he or she is exposed to unfamiliar people or pos-sible scrutiny by others, and may react in a humiliatingor embarrassing way. The exposure to the feared situa-tion produces an anxiety attack. Fear of these episodesof anxiety leads to avoidance behavior, which impairsnormal social functioning, including working or attend-ing classes. The patient is aware that these fears areunjustified.\\nDescription\\nIn psychiatric practice, treatment of anxiety has\\nlargely turned from traditional antianxiety agents, anxi-olytics, to antidepressant therapies. In current use, thebenzodiazepines , the best known class of anxiolytics,\\nhave been largely supplanted by serotonin-specific reup-take inhibitors (SSRIs, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxam-ine and others) which have a milder side effect profileand less risk of dependency. However, traditional anxi-olytics remain useful for patients who need a rapid onsetof action, or whose frequency of exposure to anxiety pro-voking stimuli is low enough to eliminate the need forcontinued treatment. While SSRIs may require three tofive weeks to show any effects, and must be taken contin-uously, benzodiazepines may produce a response within30 minutes, and may be dosed on an as-needed basis.\\nThe intermediate action benzodiazepines, alprazo-\\nlam (Xanax), and lorazepam (Ativan) are the appropriatechoice for treatment of mild anxiety and social phobia.Diazepam (Valium) is still widely used for anxiety, butits active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, which has along half-life, may make this a poorer choice than otherdrugs in its class. Note that there is considerable varia-tion between individuals in metabolism of benzodi-azepines, so patient response may not be predictable. Asa class, benzodiazepines are used not only as anxiolytics,but also as sedatives, muscle relaxants , and in treatment\\nof epilepsy and alcoholism . The distinctions between\\nthese uses are largely determined by onset and durationof action, and route of administration.\\nBuspirone (BuSpar), which is not chemically related\\nto other classes of central nervous system drugs, is also atraditional anxiolytic, although it is now consideredeither a third line or adjunctive agent for use after trialsof SSRIs and benzodiazepines. It is appropriate for use inpatients who have either failed trials of other treatments,or who should not receive benzodiazepines because of ahistory of substance abuse problems. Buspirone, in com-mon with antidepressants, requires a two to three weekperiod before there is clinical evidence of improvement,and must be continuously dosed to maintain its effects.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 231Antianxiety drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 231'),\n",

Symptoms such as shortness of breath,sweating, dizziness, chest pain, and extreme fearoften accompany the attacks.\\nPhobia —An intense, abnormal, or illogical fear of\\nsomething specific, such as heights or open spaces.\\nPregnancy category B —Animal studies indicate\\nno fetal risk, but no human studies; or adverseeffects in animals, but not in well-controlledhuman studies.\\nPregnancy category C —No adequate human or\\nanimal studies; or adverse fetal effects in animalstudies, but no available human data.\\nSeizure —A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.Purpose\\nNormally, the heart beats at a steady, even pace. The\\npace is controlled by electrical signals that begin in one partof the heart and quickly spread through the whole heart. Ifsomething goes wrong with this control system, the resultmay be an irregular heartbeat, or an arrhythmia. Antiar-rhythmic drugs correct irregular heartbeats, restoring thenormal rhythm. If the heart is beating too fast, these drugswill slow it down. By correcting these problems, antiar-rhythmic drugs help the heart work more efficiently.\\nDescription\\nAntiarrhythmic drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and are sold in capsule (regularand extended release), tablet (regular and extended-release), and injectable forms. Commonly used antiar-rhythmic drugs are disopyramide (Norpace, NorpaceCR), procainamide (Procan SR, Pronestyl, Pronestyl-SR), and quinidine (Cardioquin, Duraquin, Quinidex,and other brands). Do not confuse quinidine with qui-\\nnine, which is a related medicine with different uses, suchas relieving leg cramps.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantiarrhythmic drug and other factors. Doses may be dif-ferent for different patients. Check with the physicianwho prescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled theprescription for the correct dosage.\\nAlways take antiarrhythmic drugs exactly as direct-\\ned. Never take larger or more frequent doses.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine without checking\\nwith the physician who prescribed it. Stopping it sudden-ly could lead to a serious change in heart function.\\nAntiarrhythmic drugs work best when they are at\\nconstant levels in the blood. To help keep levels constant,take the medicine in doses spaced evenly through the dayand night. Do not miss any doses. If taking medicine atnight interferes with sleep, or if it is difficult to remem-ber to take the medicine during the day, check with ahealth care professional for suggestions.\\nPrecautions\\nPersons who take these drugs should see their physi-\\ncian regularly. The physician will check to make sure themedicine is working as it should and will note anyunwanted side effects.\\nSome people feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when\\nusing these drugs.

Their airways become inflamed andblocked with mucus during asthma attacks, narrowing theopening through which air passes. This is not such a prob-lem when the person breathes in, because the airways nat-urally expand when a person takes a breath. The real prob-lem arises when the person with asthma tries to breatheout. The air cannot get out through the blocked airways, soit stays trapped in the lungs. With each new breath, theperson can take in only a little more air, so breathingbecomes shallow and takes more and more effort.\\nAsthma attacks can be caused by allergies to pollen,\\ndust, pets or other things, but people without knownallergies may also have asthma. Exercise ,stress , intense\\nemotions, exposure to cold, certain medicines and somemedical conditions also can bring on attacks.\\nThe two main approaches to dealing with asthma are\\navoiding substances and situations that trigger attacksand using medicines that treat or prevent the symptoms.With a combination of the two, most people with asthmacan find relief and live normal lives.\\nDescription\\nThree types of drugs are used in treating and pre-\\nventing asthma attacks:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 236Antiasthmatic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 236'),\n",

It comes in aerosol canisters, in capsules thatare inserted into an inhaler, and in liquid form that isused in a nebulizer.\\nPrecautions\\nUsing antiasthmatic drugs properly is important.\\nBecause bronchodilators provide quick relief, some peo-ple may be tempted to overuse them. However, withsome kinds of bronchodilators, this can lead to seriousand possibly life-threatening complications. In the longrun, patients are better off using bronchodilators only asdirected and also using corticosteroids, which eventually\\nwill reduce their need for bronchodilators.\\nPatients who are using their antiasthmatic drugs cor-\\nrectly but feel their asthma is not under control shouldsee their physicians. The physician can either increasethe dose, switch to another medicine or add another med-icine to the regimen.\\nCorticosteroids are powerful drugs that may cause\\nserious side effects when used over a long time. However,these problems are much less likely with the inhalantforms than with the oral and injected forms. While theoral and injected forms generally should be used only forone to two weeks, the inhalant forms may be used forlong periods.\\nWhen used to prevent asthma attacks, cromolyn\\nmust be taken as directed every day.

The bacteria Clostridia difficile are normally\\nfound in the intestines of 5% of healthy adults, but peo-ple can also pick up the bacteria while they are in a hos-pital or nursing home. In a healthy person, harmless resi-dent intestinal bacteria compete with each other for foodand places to “sit” along the inner intestinal wall. Whenantibiotics are given, most of the resident bacteria areKEY TERMS\\nAsthma —A disease in which the air passages of\\nthe lungs become inflamed and narrowed.\\nInflammation —Pain, redness, swelling, and heat\\nthat usually develop in response to injury or ill-ness.\\nInhalant —Medicine that is breathed into the\\nlungs.\\nMucus —Thick fluid produced by the moist mem-\\nbranes that line many body cavities and structures.\\nNebulizer —A device that turns liquid forms of\\nmedicine into a fine spray that can be inhaled.killed. With fewer bacteria to compete with, the normally\\nharmless Clostridia difficile grow rapidly and produce\\ntoxins. These toxins damage the inner wall of theintestines and cause inflammation and diarrhea .\\nAlthough all antibiotics can cause this disease, it is\\nmost commonly caused by clindamycin (Cleocin), ampi-cillin (Omnipen), amoxicillin (Amoxil, Augmentin, orWymox), and any in the cephalosporin class (such ascefazolin or cephalexin). Symptoms of the condition canoccur during antibiotic treatment or within four weeksafter the treatment has stopped.\\nIn approximately half of cases of antibiotic-associated\\ncolitis, the condition progresses to a more severe form ofcolitis called pseudomembranous enterocolitis in whichpseudomembranes are excreted in the stools. Pseudomem-branes are membrane-like collections of white blood cells,mucus, and the protein that causes blood to clot (fibrin)that are released by the damaged intestinal wall.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis is caused by toxins pro-\\nduced by the bacterium Clostridium difficile after treat-\\nment with antibiotics. When most of the other intestinalbacteria have been killed, Clostridium difficile grows\\nrapidly and releases toxins that damage the intestinalwall. The disease and symptoms are caused by these tox-ins, not by the bacterium itself.\\nSymptoms of antibiotic-associated colitis usually\\nbegin four to ten days after antibiotic treatment hasbegun. The early signs and symptoms of this diseaseinclude lower abdominal cramps, an increased need topass stool, and watery diarrhea. As the disease progress-es, the patient may experience a general ill feeling,fatigue , abdominal pain , and fever . If the disease pro-\\nceeds to pseudomembranous enterocolitis, the patientmay also experience nausea, vomiting, large amounts ofwatery diarrhea, and a very high fever (104-105°F/40-40.5°C). Complications of antibiotic-associated colitisinclude severe dehydration , imbalances in blood miner-\\nals, low blood pressure, fluid accumulation in deep skin\\n(edema ), enlargement of the large intestine (toxic mega-\\ncolon), and the formation of a tear (perforation) in thewall of the large intestine.\\nClostridium difficile is easily spread from person to\\nperson in hospitals and nursing homes.

As a result, the elderly are much more prone todeveloping antibiotic-associated colitis than youngerindividuals.\\nDiagnosis\\nAntibiotic-associated colitis can be diagnosed by the\\nsymptoms and recent medical history of the patient, by alaboratory test for the bacterial toxin, and/or by using aprocedure called endoscopy.\\nIf the diarrhea and related symptoms occurred after\\nthe patient received antibiotics, antibiotic-associated col-itis may be suspected. A stool sample may be analyzedfor the presence of the Clostridium difficile toxin. This\\ntoxin test is the preferred diagnostic test for antibiotic-associated colitis. One frequently used test for the toxininvolves adding the processed stool sample to a humancell culture. If the toxin is present in the stool sample, thecells die. It may take up to two days to get the resultsfrom this test. A simpler test, which provides results intwo to three hours, is also available. Symptoms and toxintest results are usually enough to diagnose the disease.\\nAnother tool that may be useful in the diagnosis of\\nantibiotic-associated colitis, however, is a procedurecalled an endoscopy that involves inserting a thin, lightedtube into the rectum to visually inspect the intestinal lin-ing. Two different types of endoscopy procedures, thesigmoidoscopy and the colonoscopy , are used to view\\ndifferent parts of the large intestine. These proceduresare performed in a hospital or doctor’s office. Patients aresedated during the procedure to make them more com-fortable and are allowed to go home after recoveringfrom the sedation .\\nTreatment\\nDiarrhea, regardless of the cause, is always treated\\nby encouraging the individual to replace lost fluids andprevent dehydration. One method to treat antibiotic-asso-ciated colitis is to simply stop taking the antibiotic thatcaused the disease. This allows the normal intestinal bac-teria to repopulate the intestines and inhibits the over-growth of Clostridium difficile . Many patients with mild\\ndisease respond well to this and are free from diarrheawithin two weeks. It is important, however, to make surethat the original disease for which the antibiotics wereprescribed is treated.KEY TERMS\\nColitis —Inflammation of the colon.\\nEdema —Fluid accumulation in a tissue.\\nEndoscopy —A procedure in which a thin, lighted\\ninstrument is inserted into the interior of a holloworgan, such as the rectum and used to visuallyinspect the inner intestinal lining.\\nFibrin —A fibrous blood protein vital to coagula-\\ntion and blood clot formation.\\nRectum —The last part of the intestine. Stool pass-\\nes through the rectum and out through the analopening.\\nToxic megacolon —Acute enlargement or dilation\\nof the large intestine.\\nBecause of the potential seriousness of this disease,\\nmost patients are given another antibiotic to control thegrowth of the Clostridium difficile , usually vancomycin\\n(Vancocin) or metronidazole (Flagyl or Protostat). Bothare designed to be taken orally four times a day for 10-14days. Upon finishing antibiotic treatment, approximately15-20% of patients will experience a relapse of diarrheawithin one to five weeks. Mild relapses can go untreatedwith great success, however, severe relapses of diarrhearequire another round of antibiotic treatment. Instead offurther antibiotic treatment, a cholestyramine resin(Questran or Prevalite) may be given. The bacterial tox-ins produced in the intestine stick to the resin and arepassed out with the resin in the stool. Unfortunately,however, vancomycin also sticks to the resin, so thesetwo drugs cannot be taken at the same time. Serious dis-ease may require hospitalization so that the patient canbe monitored, treated, and rehydrated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThe goal of alternative treatment for antibiotic-asso-\\nciated enterocolitis is to repopulate the intestinal envi-ronment with microorganisms that are normal andhealthy for the intestinal tract. These microorgansismsthen compete for space and keep the Clostridium difficile\\nfrom over-populating.\\nSeveral types of supplements can be used. Supple-\\nments containing Lactobacillus acidophilus , the bacteria\\ncommonly found in yogurt and some types of milk, Lacto-\\nbacillus bifidus , and Streptococcus faecium , are available\\nin many stores in powder, capsule, tablet, and liquid form.Acidophilus also acts as a mild antibiotic, which helps it to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 239Antibiotic-associated colitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 239'),\n",

One or morerelapses can occur. Very severe colitis can cause a tear(perforation) in the wall of the large intestine that wouldrequire major surgery. Perforation of the intestine cancause a serious abdominal infection.

Otherclasses of drugs, most notably the sulfonamides , may be\\neffective antibacterials. Similarly, some antibiotics mayhave secondary uses, such as the use of demeclocycline(Declomycin, a tetracycline derivative) to treat the syn-drome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)secretion. Other antibiotics may be useful in treating pro-tozoal infections.\\nPurpose\\nAntibiotics are used for treatment or prevention of\\nbacterial infection.\\nDescription\\nClassifications\\nAlthough there are several classification schemes for\\nantibiotics, based on bacterial spectrum (broad versus nar-row) or route of administration (injectable versus oral ver-sus topical), or type of activity (bactericidal vs. bacteriosta-tic), the most useful is based on chemical structure. Antibi-otics within a structural class will generally show similarpatterns of effectiveness, toxicity, and allergic potential.\\nPENICILLINS. The penicillins are the oldest class of\\nantibiotics, and have a common chemical structure whichthey share with the cephalopsorins. The two groups areclassed as the beta-lactam antibiotics, and are generallybacteriocidal—that is, they kill bacteria rather thaninhibiting growth. The penicillins can be further subdi-vided. The natural pencillins are based on the originalpenicillin G structure; penicillinase-resistant penicillins,notably methicillin and oxacillin, are active even in thepresence of the bacterial enzyme that inactivates mostnatural penicillins. Aminopenicillins such as ampicillinand amoxicillin have an extended spectrum of actioncompared with the natural penicillins; extended spectrum\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 240AntibioticsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 240'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 254}, page_content='penicillins are effective against a wider range of bacteria.\\nThese generally include coverage for Pseudomonas\\naeruginaosa and may provide the penicillin in combina-\\ntion with a penicillinase inhibitor.\\nCEPHALOSPORINS. Cephalosporins and the closely\\nrelated cephamycins and carbapenems, like the pen-cillins, contain a beta-lactam chemical structure. Conse-quently, there are patterns of cross-resistance and cross-allergenicity among the drugs in these classes. The“cepha” drugs are among the most diverse classes ofantibiotics, and are themselves subgrouped into 1st, 2ndand 3rd generations. Each generation has a broader spec-trum of activity than the one before. In addition, cefox-itin, a cephamycin, is highly active against anaerobicbacteria, which offers utility in treatment of abdominalinfections. The 3rd generation drugs, cefotaxime, cefti-zoxime, ceftriaxone and others, cross the blood-brainbarrier and may be used to treat meningitis and\\nencephalitis . Cephalopsorins are the usually preferred\\nagents for surgical prophylaxis .\\nFLUROQUINOLONES. The fluroquinolones are syn-\\nthetic antibacterial agents, and not derived from bacteria.They are included here because they can be readily inter-changed with traditional antibiotics. An earlier, relatedclass of antibacterial agents, the quinolones, were notwell absorbed, and could be used only to treat urinarytract infections. The fluroquinolones, which are based onthe older group, are broad-spectrum bacteriocidal drugsthat are chemically unrelated to the penicillins or thecephaloprosins. They are well distributed into bone tis-sue, and so well absorbed that in general they are aseffective by the oral route as by intravenous infusion.\\nTETRACYCLINES. Tetracyclines got their name\\nbecause they share a chemical structure that has fourrings. They are derived from a species of Streptomyces\\nbacteria. Broad-spectrum bacteriostatic agents, thetetracyclines may be effective against a wide varietyof microorganisms, including rickettsia and amebicparasites.\\nMACROLIDES. The macrolide antibiotics are derived\\nfrom Streptomyces bacteria, and got their name because\\nthey all have a macrocyclic lactone chemical structure.Erythromycin, the prototype of this class, has a spectrumand use similar to penicillin. Newer members of thegroup, azithromycin and clarithyromycin, are particular-ly useful for their high level of lung penetration. Clar-ithromycin has been widely used to treat Helicobacter\\npylori infections, the cause of stomach ulcers.\\nOTHERS. Other classes of antibiotics include the\\naminoglycosides , which are particularly useful for their\\neffectiveness in treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa infec-tions; the lincosamindes, clindamycin and lincomycin,\\nwhich are highly active against anaerobic pathogens.There are other, individual drugs which may have utilityin specific infections.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage varies with drug, route of administration,\\npathogen, site of infection, and severity. Additional con-siderations include renal function, age of patient, andother factors. Consult manufacturers’ recommendationsfor dose and route.\\nSide effects\\nAll antibiotics cause risk of overgrowth by non-sus-\\nceptible bacteria. Manufacturers list other major hazardsby class; however, the health care provider should revieweach drug individually to assess the degree of risk. Gen-erally, breastfeeding is not recommended while takingantibiotics because of risk of alteration to infant’s intesti-nal flora, and risk of masking infection in the infant.Excessive or inappropriate use may promote growth ofresistant pathogens.\\nPenicillins: Hypersensitivity may be common, and\\ncross allergenicity with cephalosporins has been reported.Penicillins are classed as category B during pregnancy .\\nCephalopsorins: Several cephalopsorins and related\\ncompounds have been associated with seizures.

Many antibiotic first-aid products con-tain combinations of antibiotics to make them effectiveagainst a broad range of bacteria.\\nWhen treating a wound, it is not enough to simply\\napply a topical antibiotic. The wound must first be cleanedwith soap and water and patted dry. After the antibiotic isapplied, the wound should be covered with a dressing,such as a bandage or a protective gel or spray. For manyyears, it was thought that wounds heal best when exposedto the air. But now most experts say it is best to keepwounds clean and moist while they heal. The coveringshould still allow some air to reach the wound, however.\\nDescription\\nSome topical antibiotics are available without a pre-\\nscription and are sold in many forms, including creams,ointments, powders, and sprays. Some widely used topi-cal antibiotics are bacitracin, neomycin, mupirocin, andpolymyxin B.

Drug therapy may beused alone, or in combination with other treatments suchas surgery or radiation therapy .\\nPurpose\\nAnticancer drugs are used to control the growth of\\ncancerous cells. Cancer is commonly defined as the\\nuncontrolled growth of cells, with loss of differentiationand commonly, with metastasis, spread of the cancer toother tissues and organs. Cancers are malignant growths.In contrast, benign growths remain encapsulated and growwithin a well-defined area. Although benign tumors maybe fatal if untreated, due to pressure on essential organs, asin the case of a benign brain tumor , surgery or radiation\\nare the preferred methods of treating growths which have awell defined location. Drug therapy is used when thetumor has spread, or may spread, to all areas of the body.\\nDescription\\nSeveral classes of drugs may be used in cancer treat-\\nment, depending on the nature of the organ involved. Forexample, breast cancers are commonly stimulated byestrogens, and may be treated with drugs which inactivethe sex hormones. Similarly, prostate cancer may be\\ntreated with drugs that inactivate androgens, the male sexhormone. However, the majority of antineoplastic drugsKEY TERMS\\nCataract —Clouding of the lens of the eye, leading\\nto poor vision or blindness.\\nImpotent —Unable to achieve or maintain an\\nerection of the penis.\\nact by interfering with cell growth. Since cancerous cells\\ngrow more rapidly than other cells, the drugs target thosecells which are in the process of reproducing themselves.As a result, antineoplastic drugs will commonly affectnot only the cancerous cells, but others cells that com-monly reproduce quickly, including hair follicles, ovariesand testis, and the blood-forming organs.\\nNewer approaches to antineoplastic drug therapy\\nhave taken different approaches, including angigenesis—the inhibition of formation of blood vessels feeding thetumor and contributing to tumor growth. Although theseapproaches hold promise, they are not yet in common use.\\nAntineoplastic drugs may be divided into two class-\\nes: cycle specific and non-cycle specific. Cycle specificdrugs act only at specific points of the cell’s duplicationcycle, such as anaphase or metaphase, while non-cyclespecific drugs may act at any point in the cell cycle. Inorder to gain maximum effect, antineoplastic drugs arecommonly used in combinations.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause antineoplastic agents do not target specific\\ncell types, they have a number of common adverse sideeffects. Hair loss is common due to the effects on hair fol-licles, and anemia, immune system impairment, and clot-ting problems are caused by destruction of the blood form-ing organs, leading to reduction in the number of red cells,white cells, and platelets. Because of the frequency andseverity of these side effects, it is common to administerchemotherapy in cycles, allowing time for recovery from\\nthe drug effects before administering the next dose. Dosesare often calculated, not on the basis of weight, but ratherbased on blood counts, in order to avoid dangerous levelsof anemia (red cell depletion), neutropenia (white cell\\ndeficiency), or thrombocytopenia (platelet deficiency.)\\nNausea and vomiting are among the most common\\nadverse effects of cancer chemotherapy, and in somecases may be severe enough to cause dose reduction ordiscontinuation of treatment.\\nThe health professional has many responsibilities in\\ndealing with patients undergoing chemotherapy.

These may be permanent, and youngerpatients should be aware of the high risk of sterility afterchemotherapy.\\nThe patient must also know which side effects\\nshould be reported to the practitioner, since manyadverse effects do not appear until several days after adose of chemotherapy. When chemotherapy is self-administered, the patient must be familiar with properuse of the drugs, including dose scheduling and avoid-ance of drug-drug and food-drug interactions.\\nAppropriate steps should be taken to minimize side\\neffects. These may include administration of antinause-ant medications to reduce nausea and vomiting, main-taining fluid levels to reduce drug toxicity, particularly tothe kidneys, or application of a scalp tourniquet to reduceblood flow to the scalp and minimize hair loss due todrug therapy.\\nPatients receiving chemotherapy are also at risk of\\ninfections due to reduced white blood counts. While pro-phylactic antibiotics may be useful, the health care pro-\\nfessional should also be sure to use standard precautions,including gowns and gloves when appropriate. Patientsshould be alerted to avoid risks of viral contamination,\\nand live virus immunizations are contraindicated untilthe patient has fully recovered from the effects ofchemotherapy. Similarly, the patient should avoid contactwith other people who have recently had live virusimmunizations.\\nOther precautions which should be emphasized are\\nthe risks to pregnant or nursing women. Because antineo-plastic drugs are commonly harmful to the fetus, womenof childbearing potential should be cautioned to use twoeffective methods of birth control while receiving cancerchemotherapy.

Anticoagulant drugs fall intothree categories: inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis,inhibitors of thrombin and antiplatelet drugs.\\nPurpose\\nAnticoagulant drugs reduce the ability of the blood\\nto form clots. Although blood clotting is essential to pre-vent serious bleeding in the case of skin cuts, clots insidethe blood vessels block the flow of blood to major organsand cause heart attacks and strokes. Although these drugsare sometimes called blood thinners, they do not actuallythin the blood. Furthermore, this type of medication willnot dissolve clots that already have formed, although thedrug stops an existing clot from worsening. However,another type of drug, used in thrombolytic therapy , will\\ndissolve existing clots.\\nAnticoagulant drugs are used for a number of condi-\\ntions. For example, they may be given to prevent bloodclots from forming after the replacement of a heart valveor to reduce the risk of a stroke or another heart attack\\nafter a first heart attack. They are also used to reduce thechance of blood clots forming during open heart surgeryor bypass surgery. Low doses of these drugs may begiven to prevent blood clots in patients who must stay inbed for a long time after certain types of surgery.\\nBecause anticoagulants affect the blood’s ability to\\nclot, they can increase the risk of severe bleeding andheavy blood loss. It is thus essential to take these drugsexactly as directed and to see a physician regularly aslong as they are prescribed.\\nDescription\\nAnticoagulant drugs, also called anticlotting drugs\\nor blood thinners, are available only with a physician’sprescription. They come in tablet and injectable forms.They fall into three groups:\\n• Inhibitors of clotting factor synthesis. These anticoagu-\\nlants inhibit the production of certain clotting factors inthe liver. One example is warfarin (brand name:coumadin).\\n• Inhibitors of thrombin. Thrombin inhibitors interfere\\nwith blood clotting by blocking the activity of throm-bin. They include heparin, lepirudin (Refludan).\\n• Antiplatelet drugs. Antiplatelet drugs interact with\\nplatelets, which is a type of blood cell, to blockplatelets from aggregating into harmful clots. Theyinclude: aspirin , ticlopidine (Ticlid), clopidogrel (Plav-\\nix), tirofiban (Aggrastat), and eptifibatide (Integrilin).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanticoagulant drug and the medical condition for which itis prescribed. The prescribing physician or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription can provide information con-cerning the correct dosage. Usually, the physician willadjust the dose after checking the patient’s clotting time.\\nAnticoagulant drugs must be taken exactly as direct-\\ned by the physician. Larger or more frequent dosesshould not be taken, and the drug should also not betaken for longer than prescribed. Taking too much of this\\nmedication can cause severe bleeding. Anticoagulants\\nshould also be taken on schedule. A record of each doseshould be kept as it is taken. If a dose is missed, it shouldbe taken as soon as possible followed by the regular doseschedule. However, a patient who forgets to take amissed dose until the next day should not take the misseddose at all and should not double the next dose, as thiscould lead to bleeding. A record of all missed dosesshould be kept for the prescribing physician who shouldbe informed at the scheduled visits.\\nPrecautions\\nPersons who take anticoagulants should see a physi-\\ncian regularly while taking these drugs, particularly atthe beginning of therapy. The physician will order peri-odic blood tests to check the blood’s clotting ability. Theresults of these tests will help the physician determinethe proper amount of medication to be taken each day.\\nTime is required for normal clotting ability to return\\nafter anticoagulant treatment. During this period, patientsmust observe the same precautions they observed whiletaking the drug. The length of time needed for the bloodto return to normal depends on the type of anticoagulantdrug that was taken. The prescribing physician will adviseas to how long the precautions should be observed.\\nPeople who are taking anticoagulant drugs should\\ntell all physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and other med-ical professionals who provide medical treatments or ser-vices to them that they are taking such a medication.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 250Anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 250'),\n",

A normal, balanced diet should be followedevery day while taking such medication. No dietarychanges should be made without informing first the pre-scribing physician, who should also be told of any illnessor other condition interfering with the ability to eat nor-mally. Diet is a very important consideration because theamount of vitamin K in the body affects how anticoagu-lant drugs work. Dicoumarol and warfarin act by reduc-ing the effects of vitamin K. Vitamin K is found in meats,dairy products, leafy, green vegetables, and some multi-ple vitamins and nutritional supplements. For the drugs\\nto work properly, it is best to have the same amount ofvitamin K in the body all the time. Foods containing vita-min K in the diet should not be increased or decreasedwithout consulting with the prescribing physician. If thepatient takes vitamin supplements, he should check thelabel to see if it contains vitamin K. Because vitamin K isalso produced by intestinal bacteria, a severe case ofdiarrhea or the use of laxatives may also alter a person’s\\nvitamin K levels.\\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\\nAnticonvulsant drugs\\nDefinition\\nAnticonvulsant drugs are medicines used to prevent\\nor treat convulsions (seizures).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 252Anticonvulsant drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 252'),\n",

Epilepsy is not a single disease—itis a set of symptoms that may have different causes indifferent people. The common thread is an imbalance inthe brain’s electrical activity. This imbalance causesseizures that may affect part or all of the body and mayor may not cause a loss of consciousness. Anticonvulsantdrugs act on the brain to reduce the frequency and severi-ty of seizures.\\nSome cases of epilepsy are brought on by head\\ninjuries, brain tumors or infections, or metabolic prob-lems such as low blood sugar. But in some people withepilepsy, the cause is not clear.\\nAnticonvulsant drugs are an important part of the\\ntreatment program for epilepsy. Different kinds of drugsmay be prescribed for different types of seizures. In addi-tion to taking medicine, patients with epilepsy should getenough rest, avoid stress , and practice good health habits.\\nSome physicians believe that giving the drugs to\\nchildren with epilepsy may prevent the condition fromgetting worse in later life. However, others say the effectsare the same, whether treatment is started early or later inlife. Determining when treatment begins depends on thephysician and his assessment of the patient’s symptoms.\\nPhysicians also prescribe certain anticonvulsant\\ndrugs for other conditions, including bipolar disorder\\nand migraine headaches.\\nDescription\\nAnticonvulsant drugs may be divided into several\\nclasses. The hydantoins include pheytoin (Dilantin) andmephenytoin (Mesantoin.) Ther succimides include etho-suximide (Zarontin)and methsuccimide (Celontin.) Thebenzodiazepines , which are better known for their use as\\ntranquilizers and sedatives, include clonazepam(Klonopin), clorazepate (Tranxene) and diazepam (Vali-um.) There are also a large number of other drugs whichare not related to larger groups. These include carba-mazepine (Tegretol), valproic acid (Depakote, Depak-ene) gabapentin (Neurontin), topiramate (Topamax), fel-bamate (Felbatol) and several others. Phenobarbital hasbeen used as an anticonvulsant, and is still useful forsome patients. The drugs are available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liquid,and “sprinkle” forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nanticonvulsant, its strength, and the type of seizures forwhich it is being taken. Check with the physician whoprescribed the drug or the pharmacist who filled the pre-\\nscription for the correct dosage.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly after tak-\\ning it for several weeks or more. Gradually tapering thedose may reduce the chance of withdrawal effects.\\nDo not change brands or dosage forms of this medi-\\ncine without checking with a pharmacist or physician. If aprescription refill does not look like the original medicine,check with the pharmacist who filled the prescription.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients on anticonvulsant drugs should see a physi-\\ncian regularly while on therapy, especially during thefirst few months. The physician will check to make surethe medicine is working as it should and will noteunwanted side effects. The physician may also need toadjust the dosage during this period.\\nValproic acid can cause serious liver damage, espe-\\ncially in the first 6 months of treatment. Children are par-ticularly at risk, but anyone taking this medicine shouldsee their physician regularly for tests of liver function andshould be alert to symptoms of liver damage, such as yel-low skin and eyes, facial swelling, loss of appetite, gener-al feeling of illness, loss of appetite, and vomiting. If liverproblems are suspected, call a physician immediately.\\nFelbatol has caused serious liver damage and aplas-\\ntic anemia , a condition in which the bone marrow stops\\nproducing blood cells. Patients taking this drug shouldhave regular blood counts, and should stop taking thedrug if there are too few red blood cells.\\nWhile taking anticonvulsant drugs, do not start or\\nstop taking any other medicines without checking with aphysician. The other medicines may affect the way theanticonvulsant medicine works.\\nBecause anticonvulsant drugs work on the central\\nnervous system, they may add to the effects of alcoholand other drugs that slow down the central nervous sys-tem, such as antihistamines , cold medicine, allergy\\nmedicine, sleep aids, other medicine for seizures, tran-quilizers, some pain relievers, and muscle relaxants .\\nAnyone taking anticonvulsant drugs should check withhis or her physician before drinking alcohol or taking anymedicines that slow the central nervous system.\\nAnticonvulsant drugs may interact with medicines\\nused during surgery, dental procedures, or emergencytreatment.

The formal diagnosis requiresa cluster of symptoms, lasting at least two weeks. Thesesymptoms include, but are not limited to mood changes,insomnia or hypersomnia, and diminished interest in\\ndaily activities. The symptoms are not caused by anymedical condition, drug side effect, or adverse life event.The condition is severe enough to cause clinically signif-icant distress or impairment in social, occupational, orother important areas of functioning.Secondary depression, depression caused by unfa-\\nvorable life events, is normally self limiting, and may bebest treated with cognitive/behavioral therapy rather thandrugs.\\nDescription\\nAntidepressant agents act by increasing the levels of\\nexcitatory neurostransmitters. The main types of antide-pressant drugs in use today are:\\n• tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline (Elavil),\\nimipramine (Tofranil), nortriptyline (Pamelor)\\n•selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs or\\nserotonin boosters), such as fluoxetine (Prozac), parox-etine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft)\\n•monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors),\\nsuch as phenelzine (Nardil), and tranylcypromine (Par-nate)\\n• tetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants\\nwhich do not fall into any of the above categories\\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors maintain lev-\\nels of the excitatory neurohormone serotonin in thebrain. They do not alter levels of norepinephrine. Thesehave become the drugs of choice for a variety of psychi-atric disorders, primarily because of their low incidenceof severe side effects as compared with other drugs inthis therapeutic class. SSRIs show similar actions andside effect profiles, but may vary in duration of action.\\nTricyclic compounds, identified by their chemical\\nstructure containing three carbon rings, are an older classof antidepressants. Although generally effective, theyhave a high incidence of anticholinergic effects, notablydry mouth and dry eyes, which can cause discomfort.\\nThey also cause cardiac arrythmias. Because tricyclicsact on both serotonin and norepinephrine, they may havesome value in treatment of patients who fail to respond toSSRIs. Drugs in this class are often available at lowprices, which may be significant when cost is a majorfactor in treatment. They have also been found useful incontrol of some neurologic pain syndromes.\\nTricyclic antidepressants are similar, but may vary in\\nseverity of side effects, most notably the degree of seda-\\ntion and the extent of the anticholinergic effects.\\nTetracyclic compounds and atypical antidepressants\\nare chemically distinct from both the major groups andeach other. Although maprotilene (no brand name, mar-keted in generic form only) and mirtazepine (Remeron)are similar in chemical structures, they differ in their bal-ance of activity on serotonine and norepinephrine levels.\\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine [Nardil],\\ntranylcypromine [Parnate]) have largely been supplanted\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 256Antidepressant drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 256'),\n",

They act by\\ninhibiting the enzyme monoamine oxidase, which isresponsible for the metabolism of the stimulatory neuro-hormones norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine, andserotonin. The MAOIs are normally reserved for patientswho are resistant to safer drugs. Two drugs, eldepryl(Carbex, used in treatment of Parkinson’s disease ) and\\nthe herb, St. John’s wort , have some action against\\nmonoamine oxidase B, and have shown some value asanti-depressants. They do not share the same risks as thenon-selective MAO inhibitors.\\nAll antidepressant agents, regardless of their struc-\\nture, have a slow onset of action, typically three to fiveweeks. Although adverse effects may be seen as early asthe first dose, significant therapeutic improvement isalways delayed. Similarly, the effects of antidepressantswill continue for a similar length of time after the drugshave been discontinued.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDose varies with the specific drug and patient.

Although a few are listed here, specificreferences should be consulted for more complete infor-mation.\\nSSRIs. The most common side effect of SSRIs is exci-\\ntation and insomnia. Excitation has been reported in over20% of patients, and insomnia in 33%. Significant weightloss has been frequently reported, but most commonly inpatients who are already underweight. SSRIs may causesome sedation, and patients should be cautioned not to per-form tasks requiring alertness until they have evaluated the\\neffects of these drugs. SSRIs are pregnancy category C\\ndrugs. Most SSRIs are excreted in breast milk, and therehave been anecdotal reports of somnolence in infantswhose mothers were taking SSRIs while breastfeeding.\\nTricyclic antidepressants. Amoxepine (not marketed\\nby brand, generic available), although a tricyclic antide-pressant rather than a neuroleptic (major tranquilizer),displays some of the more serious effects of the neu-roleptics, including tardive dyskinesias (drug inducedinvoluntary movements) and neuroleptic malignant syn-drome, a potentially fatal syndrome whose symptomsinclude high fever , altered mental status, irregular pulse\\nor blood pressure, and changes in heart rate. Theseadverse effects have not been reported with other tri-cyclic antidepressants.\\nThe most common adverse effects of tricyclic antide-\\npressants are sedation and the anticholinergic effects,such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and difficult urination. Alter-ations in heartbeat are also common, and may progress tocongestive heart failure ,stroke , and sudden death .\\nTricyclic antidepressants are in pregnancy categories\\nC or D, although there have been no formal studies of thedrugs on fetal development. There are no studies ofeffects on newborns, but some anecdotal reports of mal-formations have resulted from animal studies. The drugsare excreted in breast milk.\\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors. The greatest risk\\nassociated with these drugs is a hypertensive crisis whichmay be fatal and most often occurs when the drugs aretaken with interacting foods or drugs. More commonadverse reactions may include low blood pressure andslowing of heartbeat. Sedation and gastrointestinal distur-bances are also common. MAOIs are in pregnancy cate-gory C.

Type I is caused\\nby a deficiency of insulin production, while type II ischaracterized by insulin resistance.\\nTreatment of type I diabetes is limited to insulin\\nreplacement, while type II diabetes is treatable by a num-ber of therapeutic approaches. Many cases of insulinresistance are asymptomatic due to normal increases ininsulin secretion, and others may be controlled by dietand exercise . Drug therapy may be directed towards\\nincreasing insulin secretion, increasing insulin sensitivi-ty, or increasing insulin penetration of the cells.\\nDescription\\nAntidiabetic drugs may be subdivided into six groups:\\ninsulin, sufonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors,biguanides, meglitinides, and thiazolidinediones.\\nInsulin (Humulin, Novolin) is the hormone responsi-\\nble for glucose utilization. It is effective in both types ofdiabetes, since, even in insulin resistance, some sensitivi-ty remains and the condition can be treated with largerdoses of insulin. Most insulins are now produced byrecombinant DNA techniques, and are chemically identi-cal to natural human insulin. Isophane insulin suspen-sion, insulin zinc suspension, and other formulations areintended to extend the duration of action of insulin, andpermit glucose control over longer periods of time.\\nSulfonylureas (chlorpropamide [Diabinese], tolaza-\\nmide [Tolinase], glipizide [Glucotrol] and others) act byincreasing insulin release from the beta cells of the pan-crease. Glimepiride (Amaryl), a member of this class,appears to have a useful secondary action in increasinginsulin sensitivity in peripheral cells.\\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors (acarbose [Precose],\\nmiglitol [Glyset]) do not enhance insulin secretion.Rather, they inhibit the conversion of disaccharides andcomplex carbohydrates to glucose. This mechanism doesnot prevent conversion, but only delays it, reducing thepeak blood glucose levels. Alpha-glucosidase inhibitorsare useful for either monotherapy or in combination ther-apy with sulfonylureas or other hypoglycemic agents.\\nMetformin (Glucophage) is the only available mem-\\nber of the biguanide class. Metformin decreases hepaticglucose production, decreases intestinal absorption ofglucose and increases peripheral glucose uptake and uti-lization. Metformin may be used as monotherapy, or incombination therapy with a sulfonylurea.\\nThere are two members of the meglitinide class:\\nrepaglinide (Prandin) and nateglitinide (Starlix). Themechanism of action of the meglitinides is to stimulateinsulin production. This activity is both dose dependentand dependent on the presence of glucose, so that thedrugs have reduced effectiveness in the presence of low\\nblood glucose levels. The meglitinides may be used alone,or in combination with metformin. The manufacturerwarns that nateglitinide should not be used in combina-tion with other drugs which enhance insulin secretion.\\nRosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos)\\nand the members of the thiazolidinedione class. They actby both reducing glucose production in the liver, andincreasing insulin dependent glucose uptake in musclecells. They do not increase insulin production. Thesedrugs may be used in combination with metoformin or asulfonylurea.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage must be highly individualized for all antidia-\\nbetic agents and is based on blood glucose levels whichmust be taken regularly. Review specific literature.\\nPrecautions\\nInsulin. The greatest short term risk of insulin is\\nhypoglycemia , which may be the result of either a direct\\noverdose or an imbalance between insulin injection andlevel of exercise and diet. This may also occur in thepresence of other conditions which reduce the glucoseload, such as illness with vomiting and diarrhea . Treat-\\nment is with glucose in the form of glucose tablets or liq-uid, although severe cases may require intravenous thera-py. Allergic reactions and skin reactions may also occur.Insulin is classified as category B in pregnancy , and is\\nconsidered the drug of choice for glucose control duringpregnancy. Insulin glargine (Lantus), an insulin analogwhich is suitable for once-daily dosing, is classified ascategory C, because there have been reported changes inthe hearts of newborns in animal studies of this drug. Thereports are essentially anecdotal, and no cause and effectrelationship has been determined. Insulin is not recom-mended during breast feeding because either low of highdoses of insulin may inhibit milk production. Insulinadministered orally is destroyed in the GI tract, and rep-resents no risk to the newborn.\\nSulonylureas. All sulfonylurea drugs may cause\\nhypoglycemia. Most patients become resistant to thesedrugs over time, and may require either dose adjustmentsor a switch to insulin. The list of adverse reactions isextensive, and includes central nervous system problemsand skin reactions, among others. Hematologic reactions,although rare, may be severe and include aplastic ane-\\nmia and hemolytic anemia . The administration of oral\\nhypoglycemic drugs has been associated with increasedcardiovascular mortality as compared with treatmentwith diet alone or diet plus insulin.

Because theremay be significant alterations in blood glucose levelsduring pregnancy, it is recommended that patients beswitch to insulin. These drugs have not been fully studiedduring breast feeding, but it is recommended thatbecause their presence in breast milk might cause hypo-glycemia in the newborn, breastfeeding be avoided whiletaking sulfonylureas.\\nAlpha-glucosidase inhibitors are generally well tol-\\nerated, and do not cause hypoglycemia. The most com-mon adverse effects are gastrointestinal problems,including flatulence, diarrhea, and abdominal pain .\\nThese drugs are classified as category B in pregnancy.Although there is no evidence that the drugs are harmfulto the fetus, it is important that rigid blood glucose con-trol be maintained during pregnancy, and pregnantwomen should be switched to insulin. Alpha-glucosidaseinhibitors may be excreted in small amounts in breastmilk, and it is recommended that the drugs not be admin-istered to nursing mothers.\\nMetformin causes gastrointestinal reactions in about\\na third of patients. A rare, but very serious, reaction tometformin is lactic acidosis, which is fatal in about 50%of cases. Lactic acidosis occurs in patients with multiplemedical problems, including renal insufficiency. The riskmay be reduced with careful renal monitoring, and care-ful dose adjustments to metformin. Metformin is catego-ry B during pregnancy. There have been no carefullycontrolled studies of the drug during pregnancy, but thereis no evidence of fetal harm from animal studies. It isimportant that rigid blood glucose control be maintainedduring pregnancy, and pregnant women should beswitched to insulin. Animal studies show that metforminis excreted in milk. It is recommended that metforminnot be administered to nursing mothers.\\nMeglitinides. These drugs are generally well tolerat-\\ned, with an adverse event profile similar to placebo. Thedrugs are classified as category C during pregnancy,based on fetal abnormalities in rabbits given about 40times the normal human dose. It is important that rigidblood glucose control be maintained during pregnancy,\\nand pregnant women should be switched to insulin. It isnot known whether the meglitinides are excreted inhuman milk, but it is recommended that these drugs notbe given to nursing mothers.\\nThiazolidinediones. These drugs are generally well\\ntolerated, however they are structurally related to an ear-lier drug, troglitazone, which was associated with liverfunction problems. It is strongly recommended that allpatients treated with pioglitazone or rosiglitazone haveregular liver function monitoring. The drugs are classi-fied as pregnancy category C, based on evidence of inhi-bition of fetal growth in rats given more than four timesthe normal human dose.

CategoryB: Animal studies indicate no fetal risk, but nohuman studies; or adverse effects in animals, butnot in well-controlled human studies. Category C:No adequate human or animal studies; or adversefetal effects in animal studies, but no availablehuman data. Category D: Evidence of fetal risk,but benefits outweigh risks. Category X: Evidenceof fetal risk. Risks outweigh any benefits.\\nSalicylates —A group of drugs that includes aspirin\\nand related compounds. Salicylates are used torelieve pain, reduce inflammation, and lower fever.\\nSeizure —A sudden attack, spasm, or convulsion.Purpose\\nAntidiarrheal drugs help control diarrhea and some\\nof the symptoms that go along with it. An average,healthy person has anywhere from three bowel move-ments a day to three a week, depending on that person’sdiet. Normally the stool (the material that is passed in abowel movement) has a texture something like clay. Withdiarrhea, bowel movements may be more frequent, andthe texture of the stool is thin and sometimes watery.\\nDiarrhea is not a disease, but a symptom of some other\\nproblem. The symptom may be caused by eating or drink-ing food or water that is contaminated with bacteria, virus-es, or parasites, or by eating something that is difficult todigest. People who have trouble digesting lactose (milksugar), for example, may get diarrhea if they eat dairyproducts. Some cases of diarrhea are caused by stress ,\\nwhile others are brought on by taking certain medicines.\\nDescription\\nAntidiarrheal drugs work in several ways. The drug\\nloperamide, found in Imodium A-D, for example, slowsthe passage of stools through the intestines. This allowsmore time for water and salts in the stools to beabsorbed back into the body. Adsorbents, such as atta-pulgite (found in Kaopectate) pull diarrhea-causing sub-stances from the digestive tract. However, they may alsopull out substances that the body needs, such asenzymes and nutrients. Bismuth subsalicylate, the ingre-dient in Pepto-Bismol, decreases the secretion of fluidinto the intestine and inhibits the activity of bacteria. Itnot only controls diarrhea, but relieves the cramps thatoften accompany diarrhea.\\nThese medicines come in liquid, tablet, caplet, and\\nchewable tablet forms and can be bought without aphysician’s prescription.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dose depends on the type of antidiarrheal drug.\\nRead and follow the directions on the product label. Forquestions about dosage, check with a physician or phar-macist. Never take larger or more frequent doses, and donot take the drug for longer than directed.\\nPrecautions\\nDiarrhea usually improves within 24-48 hours. If the\\nproblem lasts longer or if it keeps coming back, diarrheacould be a sign of a more serious problem.

Drugs that increase ADH levels include aceta-KEY TERMS\\nColitis —Inflammation of the colon (large bowel).\\nDehydration —Excessive loss of water from the\\nbody.\\nEnzyme —A type of protein, produced in the body,\\nthat brings about or speeds up chemical reactions.\\nNutrient —A food substance that provides energy\\nor is necessary for growth and repair. Examples ofnutrients are vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates,fats, and proteins.minophen ,barbiturates , cholinergic agents, estrogen,\\nnicotine, oral hypoglycemia agents, some diuretics\\n(e.g., thiazides), cyclophosphamide, narcotics, and tri-cyclic antidepressants. Drugs that decrease ADH levelsinclude alcohol, beta-adrenergic agents, morphine antag-onists, and phenytoin (Dilantin).\\nDescription\\nThe purpose of ADH is to control the amount of\\nwater reabsorbed by the kidneys. Water is continuallybeing taken into the body in food and drink, as well asbeing produced by chemical reactions in cells. Water isalso continually lost in urine, sweat, feces, and in thebreath as water vapor. ADH release helps maintain theoptimum amount of water in the body when there is anincrease in the concentration of the blood serum or adecrease in blood volume. Physical stress , surgery, and\\nhigh levels of anxiety can also stimulate ADH.\\nVarious factors can affect ADH production, thereby\\ndisturbing the body’s water balance. For example, alcoholconsumption reduces ADH production by direct action onthe brain, resulting in a temporarily increased productionof urine. This may also occur in diabetes insipidus, whenthe pituitary gland produces insufficient ADH, or rarely,when the kidneys fail to respond to ADH. The reverseeffect of water retention can result from temporarilyincreased ADH production after a major operation oraccident. Water retention may also be caused by thesecretion of ADH by some tumors, especially of the lung.\\nPreparation\\nThe test requires collection of a blood sample. The\\npatient must be fasting (nothing to eat or drink) for 12\\nhours, be adequately hydrated, and limit physical activityfor 10-12 hours before the test.\\nRisks\\nRisks for this test are minimal, but may include\\nslight bleeding from the blood-drawing site, fainting or\\nfeeling lightheaded after venipuncture, or hematoma(blood accumulating under the puncture site).\\nNormal results\\nADH normal ranges are laboratory-specific but can\\nrange from 1-5 pg/ml or 1.5 ng/L (SI units).\\nAbnormal results\\nPatients who are dehydrated, who have a decreased\\namount of blood in the body (hypovolemia), or who areundergoing severe physical stress (e.g., trauma, pain or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 266Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 266'),\n",

A fungus is an organism that can be either one-\\ncelled or filamentous. Unlike a plant, which makes itsown food, or an animal, which eats plants or other ani-mals, a fungus survives by invading and living off otherliving things. Fungi thrive in moist, dark places, includ-ing some parts of the body.\\nFungal infections can either be systemic, meaning\\nthat the infection is deep, or topical (dermatophytic),meaning that the infection is superficial and occurs on theskin. Additionally, yeast infections can affect the mucousmembranes of the body. Fungal infections on the skin areusually treated with creams or ointments (topical antifun-gal drugs). However, systemic infections, yeast infectionsor topical infections that do not clear up after treatmentwith creams or ointments may need to be treated with sys-temic antifungal drugs. These drugs are used, for example,to treat common fungal infections such as tinea ( ring-\\nworm ), which occurs on the skin or candidiasis (a yeast\\ninfection, also known as trush), which can occur in thethroat, in the vagina, or in other parts of the body. They arealso used to treat other deep fungal infections such ashistoplasmosis ,blastomycosis , and aspergillosis , which\\ncan affect the lungs and other organs. They are sometimesused to prevent or treat fungal infections in people whoseimmune systems are weakened, such as bone marrow ororgan transplant patients and people with AIDS .\\nDescription\\nAntifungal drugs are categorized depending on their\\nroute or site of action, their mechanism of action andtheir chemical nature.\\nSystemic antifungal drugs, such as capsofungin (Can-\\ncidas), flucytosine, fluconazole (Diflucan), itraconazole(Sporanox), ketoconazole (Nizoral), and miconazole(Monistat I.V .) are available only by prescription. They areavailable in tablet, capsule, liquid, and injectable forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantifungal drug and the nature and extent of fungal infec-tion being treated. Doses may also be different for differ-ent patients. The prescribing physician or the pharmacistcan provide dosage information. Systemic antifungaldrugs must be taken exactly as directed. Itraconazole andketoconazole should be taken with food.\\nFungal infections can take a long time to clear up, so\\nit may be necessary to take the medication for severalmonths, or even for a year or longer. It is very importantto keep taking the medicine for as long as the physiciansays to take it, even if symptoms seem to improve.

Other than theimidazoles, (miconazole [Micatin, Miconazole], clotri-mazole [Lotrimin], econazole [Spectazole], ketoconazole[Nizoral], oxiconazole [Oxistat], sulconazole [Exel-derm]) and the allylamine derivatives (butenafine [Men-tax], naftifine [Naftin], terbinafine [Lamisil]), the drugsin this therapeutic class are chemically distinct from eachother. All drugs when applied topically have a good mar-gin of safety, and most show a high degree of effective-ness.

In this condition,food and stomach juices flow backward from the stom-ach into the esophagus, the part of the digestive tractthrough which food passes on its way from the mouth tothe stomach. Normally, a muscular ring called the loweresophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food into thestomach and then closes to prevent the stomach’s con-tents from flowing back into the esophagus. In peoplewith GERD, this muscular ring is either weak or it relax-es at the wrong times. The main symptom is heartburn—a burning sensation centered behind the breastbone andspreading upward toward the neck and throat.\\nCisapride works by strengthening the lower\\nesophageal sphincter and making the stomach emptymore quickly. This shortens the amount of time that theesophagus comes in contact with the stomach contents.KEY TERMS\\nDigestive tract —The stomach, intestines, and\\nother parts of the body through which food passes.\\nDiverticulosis —A condition in which the colon\\n(large intestine) develops a number of outpouch-ings or sacs.\\nFlatulence —Excess gas in the digestive tract.\\nIrritable colon —An intestinal disorder often\\naccompanied by abdominal pain and diarrhea.Other drugs, such as H2-blockers are sometimes pre-\\nscribed to reduce the amount of acid in the stomach.\\nDescription\\nCisapride is available only with a physician’s pre-\\nscription. Cisapride is sold in tablet and liquid forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe dose depends on the patient. The average dose\\nfor adults and children age 12 and over is 5-20 mg takentwo to four times a day. The medicine should be taken 15minutes before meals and at bedtime. For children under12, the dose is based on body weight and should bedetermined by the child’s physician.\\nPrecautions\\nThis medicine is effective in treating only nighttime\\nheartburn, not daytime heartburn.\\nCisapride may increase the effects of alcohol and\\ntranquilizers.\\nCisapride has caused dangerous irregular heartbeats\\nin a few people who took it with other medicines. Any-one who takes this drug should let the physician know allother medicines he or she is taking. Patients with heartproblems should check with their physicians before tak-ing cisapride.\\nAnyone who has bleeding, blockage, or leakage in\\nthe stomach or intestines should not take cisapride. Cis-apride should not be used by anyone who has had anunusual reaction to the drug in the past. In addition, peo-ple with any of the following medical problems shouldmake sure their physicians are aware of their conditions:\\n• epilepsy or history of seizures• kidney disease\\n• liver disease\\nThe effects of taking cisapride during pregnancy\\nhave not been fully studied. Women who are pregnant orplan to become pregnant should check with their physi-cians before taking Cisapride. The drug passes intobreast milk and may affect nursing babies.

Most of these organ-isms cause infections by being ingested in the form ofeggs or larvae, usually present on contaminated food orclothing, while others gain entry through skin abrasions.Common parasitic infestations include amebiasis ,malar-\\nia,giardiasis , hookworm, pinworm, threadworm, whip-\\nworm and tapeworm infestations. Once in the body, para-sitic worms may go unnoticed if they cause no severesymptoms. However, if they multiply rapidly and spread toa major organ, they can cause very serious and even life-threatening conditions. Antihelminthic drugs are pre-scribed to treat these infestations. They function either bydestroying the worms on contact or by paralyzing them, orby altering the permeability of their plasma membranes.The dead worms then pass out of the body in the feces.\\nDescription\\nAntihelminthic drugs are available only with a pre-\\nscription and are available as liquids, tablets or capsules.Some commonly used antihelminthics include: albenda-zole (Albenza), mebendazole (Vermox), niclosamide(Niclocide), oxamniquine (Vansil), praziquantel (Biltri-cide), pyrantel (Antiminth), pyantel pamoate (Antiminth)and thiabendazole (Mintezol). Some types of parasiticinfestations are rarely seen in the United States, thus, thecorresponding antihelminthic drugs are not widely dis-tributed and need to be obtained from the United StatesCenter for Disease Control (CDC) when required. Theseinclude for example bitional and ivermectin, used to treatonchocerciasis infestations. Other antihelminthic drugs,such as diethylcarbamazepine citrate (Hetrezan), usedfor treatment of roundworms and other parasites, is sup-plied directly by its manufacturer when needed.\\nMost antihelminthic drugs are only active against spe-\\ncific parasites, some are also toxic. Before treatment, theparasites must therefore be identified using tests that lookfor parasites, eggs or larvae in feces, urine, blood, sputum,or tissues. Thus, niclosamide is used against tapeworms,but will not be effective for the treatment of pinworm orroundworm infestations, because it acts by inhibiting ATPproduction in tapeworm cells. Thiabendazole (Mintezole)is the drug usually prescribed for treatment of thread-worm, but a similar drug, mebendazole (Vermox) works\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 273Antihelminthic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 273'),\n",

They have no\\neffect on rate of histamine release, nor do they inactivatehistamine. By inhibiting the activity of histamine, theycan reduce capillary fragility, which produces the erythe-ma, or redness, associated with allergic reactions. Theywill also reduce histamine-induced secretions, includingexcessive tears and salivation. Additional effects varywith the individual drug used. Several of the older drugs,called first-generation antihistamines, bind non-selec-tively to H\\n1receptors in the central nervous system as\\nwell as to peripheral receptors, and can produce sedation,inhibition of nausea and vomiting, and reduction ofmotion sickness . The second-generation antihistamines\\nbind only to peripheral H\\n1receptors, and reduce allergic\\nresponse with little or no sedation.\\nThe first-generation antihistamines may be divided\\ninto several chemical classes. The side effect profile,which also determines the uses of the drugs, will vary bychemical class. The alkylamines include brompheni-ramine (Dimetapp) and chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trime-ton.) These agents cause relatively little sedation, and areused primarily for treatment of allergic reactions. Promet-hazine (Phenergan), in contrast, is a phenothiazine, chem-ically related to the major tranquilizers, and while it isused for treatment of allergies , may also be used as a\\nsedative, the relieve anxiety prior to surgery, as an anti-\\nnauseant, and for control of motion sickness.

Bovet studied zoology and comparative anatomyat the University of Geneva, receiving his doctor of sci-ence degree in 1929. He then joined the Pasteur Insti-tute in Paris, becoming director of the Laboratory ofTherapeutic Chemistry in 1936.\\nBovet investigated histamine, thought to cause aller-\\ngy symptoms. No antagonist of histamine was known, soBovet—with his research student Anne-Marie Staub—began studying substances that blocked hormones simi-lar to histamine. By 1937 he had produced the first anti-histamine, thymoxydiethylamine. Since this substancewas too toxic for human use, Bovet and Staub performedthousands more experiments seeking less toxic antihista-mines. This work formed the basis for the developmentof subsequent clinically useful antihistamines.\\naddition to its role in reducing allergic reactions, may be\\nused as a nighttime sedative, for control of drug-inducedParkinsonism, and, in liquid form, for control of coughs.Consult more detailed references for further information.\\nThe second generation antihistamines have no cen-\\ntral action, and are used only for treatment of allergicreactions. These are divided into two chemical classes.Cetirizine (Zyrtec) is a piperazine derivative, and has aslight sedative effect. Loratidine (Claritin) and fexofena-dine (Allegra) are members of the piperadine class andare essentially non-sedating.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage varies with drug, patient and intended use.\\nConsult more detailed references for further information.\\nWhen used for control of allergic reactions, antihista-\\nmines should be taken on a regular schedule, rather than onan as-needed basis, since they have no effect on histamineitself, nor on histamine already bound to the receptor site.\\nEfficacy is highly variable from patient to patient.

Within this therapeutic class, there are severalsubgroups. There are a very large number of drugs used tocontrol hypertension , and the drugs listed below are rep-\\nresentatives, but not the only members of their classes.\\nThe calcium channel blocking agents, also called\\nslow channel blockers or calcium antagonists, inhibit themovement of ionic calcium across the cell membrane.This reduces the force of contraction of muscles of theheart and arteries. Although the calcium channel block-\\nersare treated as a group, there are four different chemi-\\ncal classes, leading to significant variations in the activi-ty of individual drugs. Nifedipine (Adalat, Procardia) hasthe greatest effect on the blood vessels, while verapamil(Calan, Isoptin) and diltiazem (Cardizem) have a greatereffect on the heart muscle itself.\\nPeripheral vasodilators such as hydralazine\\n(Apresoline), isoxuprine (Vasodilan), and minoxidil\\n(Loniten) act by relaxing blood vessels.\\nThere are several groups of drugs which act by reduc-\\ning adrenergic nerve stimulation, the excitatory nervestimulation that causes contraction of the muscles in thearteries, veins, and heart. These drugs include the beta-adrenergic blockers and alpha/beta adrenergic blockers.There are also non-specific adrenergic blocking agents.\\nBeta-adrenergic blocking agents include propranolol\\n(Inderal), atenolol (Tenormin), and pindolol (Visken).Propranolol acts on the beta-adrenergic receptors any-where in the body, and has been used as a treatment foremotional anxiety and rapid heart beat. Atenolol andacebutolol (Sectral) act specifically on the nerves of the\\nheart and circulation.\\nThere are two alpha/beta adrenergic blockers,\\nlabetolol (Normodyne, Trandate) and carvedilol (Coreg).These work similarly to the beta blockers .\\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE\\ninhibitors) act by inhibiting the production of angiotensinII, a substance that both induces constriction of bloodvessels and retention of sodium, which leads to waterretention and increased blood volume. There are 10 ACEinhibitors currently marketed in the United States,including captopril (Capoten), benazepril (Lotensin),enalapril (Vasotec), and quinapril (Acupril). The primarydifference between these drugs is their onset and dura-tion of action.\\nThe ACE II inhibitors, losartan (Cozaar), candesar-\\ntan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), telmisartan(Micardis), valsartan (Diovan) and eprosartan (Teveten)directly inhibit the effects of ACE II rather than blockingits production. Their actions are similar to the ACEinhibitors, but they appear to have a more favorable sideeffect and safety profile.\\nIn addition to these drugs, other classes of drugs\\nhave been used to lower blood pressure, most notably thethiazide diuretics . There are 12 thiazide diuretics mar-\\nketed in the United States, including hydrochlorothiazide(Hydrodiuril, Esidrex), indapamide (Lozol), polythiazide(Renese), and hydroflumethiazide (Diucardin). Thedrugs in this class appear to lower blood pressurethrough several mechanisms. By promoting sodium lossthey lower blood volume. At the same time, the pressureof the walls of blood vessels, the peripheral vascularresistance, is lowered. Thiazide diuretics are commonlyused as the first choice for reduction of mild hyperten-sion, and may be used in combination with other antihy-pertensive drugs.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage varies with patient, drug,\\nseverity of hypertension, and whether the drug is beingused alone or in combination with other drugs. Consultspecialized references for further information.\\nPrecautions\\nBecause of the large number of classes and individ-\\nual drugs in this group, consult specialized references forcomplete information.\\nPeripheral vasodilators may cause dizziness and\\northostatic hypotension—a rapid lowering of blood pres-sure when the patient stands up in the morning.

Patients should also notify their physicianof any health problems they are currently experiencing.Patients must notify physicians if they have kidney prob-lems, since this might affect the type of drug adminis-tered. Patients must also notify their physician if they areallergic to any of the medications used to treat acute orlong-term gout . Since all of these factors contribute to\\nthe disease, patients suffering from gout should attemptto lose weight, avoid excess alcohol consumption, andavoid foods high in purines, such as asparagus, sardines,lobster, avocado, and peas.\\nDescription\\nGout and hyperuricemia\\nPersons with high levels of uric acid (hyper-\\nuricemia) may experience gout. Commonly gout occursin males in their 40s and 50s. Gout is defined by theattacks of (arthritic) painful, reddened joints, and is oftenaccompanied by hard lumps in the painful joints. Themost common joint affected is the big toe. Kidney\\nstones , and/or poor kidney function may also be associ-\\nated with hyperuricemia, but may not be considered goutif the patient does not have painful joints. In persons withgout (and associated symptoms), uric acid forms crystals,which then cause the aforementioned symptoms.Although uric acid levels must be high in order forpatients to have crystals form, and therefore have gout,most persons with high uric acid levels don’t ever havesymptoms. Thus, recent criteria for use of anti-hyper-uricemic agents suggest that patients who have neverexperienced symptoms of gout should not receive drugtherapy, unless their hyperuricemia is associated withcancer (may lead to kidney damage) or certain rare\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 281Anti-hyperuricemic drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 281'),\n",

Thus,drugs that lower uric acid levels and are used to treat goutin the long term are not used in the short term. Medica-tions used in acute gout attacks include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (such as indomethacin), colchicine,and corticosteroids . Colchicine causes side effects in a\\nlarge number of individuals (usually diarhhea). The mostimportant factor in the effective treatment of gout may notbe the drug used, but how quickly it is administered afteran acute attack has begun.\\nLong-term treatment\\nLong-term treatment of gout or hyperuricemia usu-\\nally involves one of four drugs: allopurinol, probenicid,sulphinpyrazone, or benzbromarone (as of this printingin 2001, benzbromarone is not available for use in theUnited States). While allopurinol decreases the amountof uric acid that is produced (and may help prevent acuteattacks of gout), the other drugs all increase the rate atwhich uric acid is excreted in the urine. As previouslymentioned, lowering the concentration of uric acid cancause gout attacks. Thus, patients taking these medica-tions should have the dose slowly increased (and uricacid levels slowly lowered) to prevent acute attacks ofgout. Patients may also be treated with colchicine or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to prevent acuteattacks of gout (corticosteroids are not used in this sce-nario because over the long term corticosteroids havedeleterious side effects).\\nMichael V Zuck, PhD\\nAnti-insomnia drugs\\nDefinition\\nAnti-insomnia drugs are medicines that help people\\nfall asleep or stay asleep.\\nPurpose\\nPhysicians prescribe anti-insomnia drugs for short-\\nterm treatment of insomnia—a sleep problem in whichpeople have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep orwake up too early and can’t go back to sleep. These drugsshould be used only for occasional treatment of tempo-rary sleep problems and should not be taken for more thana week or two at a time. People whose sleep problems lastlonger than this should see a physician. Their sleep prob-lems could be a sign of another medical problem.\\nDescription\\nThe anti-insomnia drug described here, zolpidem\\n(Ambien), is a classified as a central nervous system(CNS) depressant. CNS depressants are medicines thatslow the nervous system. Physicians also prescribe medi-cines in the benzodiazepine family, such as flurazepam(Dalmane), quazepam (Doral), triazolam (Halcion), esta-zolam (ProSom), and temazepam (Restoril), for insom-\\nnia. Benzodiazepine drugs are described in the essay on\\nantianxiety drugs . Zaleplon (Sonata) is another anti-\\ninsomnia drug that is not related to other drugs with thesame effect. The barbiturates , such as pentobarbital\\n(Nembutal) and secobarbital (Seconal) are no longercommonly used to treat insomnia because they are toodangerous if they are taken in overdoses. For patientswith mild insomnia, some antihistamines , such as\\ndiphenhydramine (Benadryl) or hydroxyzine (Atarax)may be used, since these also cause sleepiness.\\nZolpidem is available only with a physician’s pre-\\nscription and comes in tablet form.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose for adults is 5-10 mg just\\nbefore bedtime. The medicine works quickly, often within20 minutes, so it should be taken right before going to bed.\\nFor older people and others who may be more sensi-\\ntive to the drug’s effects, the recommended startingdosage is 5 mg just before bedtime.\\nNever take more than 10 mg of zolpidem in one 24-\\nhour period. Overdoses can lead to excessive sleepinessor coma.\\nZolpidem may be taken with food or on an empty\\nstomach, but it may work faster when taken on an emptystomach. Check with a physician or pharmacists forinstructions on how to take the medicine.\\nPrecautions\\nZolpidem is meant only for short-term treatment of\\ninsomnia. If sleep problems last more than seven to 10days, check with a physician. Longer-lasting sleep prob-lems could be a sign of another medical problem. Also,this drug may lose its effectiveness when taken everynight for more than a few weeks.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 282Anti-insomnia drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 282'),\n",

The disease is caused by a parasite,Plasmodium , which belongs to a group of one-celled\\norganisms known as protozoa. The only way to getmalaria is to be bitten by a certain type of mosquito thathas bitten someone who has the disease.Thanks to mos-quito control programs, malaria has been eliminated inthe United States, almost all of Europe, and large parts ofCentral and South America. However, mosquito controlhas not worked well in other parts of the world, andmalaria continues to be a major health problem in partsof Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, Haiti, theDominican Republic, and some Pacific Islands. Everyyear, some 30,000 Americans and Europeans who travelto these areas get malaria. People planning to travel tothe tropics are often advised to take antimalarial drugsbefore, during, and after their trips, to help them avoidgetting the disease and bringing it home with them.These drugs kill Plasmodium or prevent its growth.\\nIn recent years, some strains of Plasmodium have\\nbecome resistant to antimalarial drugs, and medicalresearchers have stepped up efforts to develop a malariavaccine. In early1997, researchers reported encouragingresults from a small study of one vaccine and planned totest the vaccine in Africa.\\nDescription\\nAntimalarial drugs are available only with a physi-\\ncian’s prescription. They come in tablet, capsule, andinjectable forms. Among the commonly used antimalari-al drugs are chloroquine (Aralen), mefloquine (Lariam),primaquine, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), and quinine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of anti-\\nmalarial drug, its strength, and the form in which it isbeing used (such as tablet or injection). The dosage mayalso be different for different people. Check with thephysician who prescribed the drug or the pharmacist whofilled the prescription for the correct dosage. Always takethis medicine exactly as directed, and keep taking it forthe full time of treatment. If the drug is being taken totreat malaria, do not stop taking it just because symptomsbegin to improve. Symptoms may return if the drug isstopped too soon. Never take larger or more frequentdoses than the physician has ordered, and do not take thedrug for longer than directed.\\nTravelers taking this medicine to prevent malaria may\\nbe told to take it for one to two weeks before their trip andfor 4 weeks afterward, as well as for the whole time theyare away. It is important to follow these directions.\\nAntimalarial drugs work best when they are taken on\\na regular schedule. When taken once a week to preventmalaria, they should be taken on the same day everyweek. When taken daily or several times a day to treatmalaria, they should be taken at the same time every day.Doses should not be missed or skipped.\\nSome antimalarial drugs should be taken with meals\\nor with milk to prevent upset stomach. Others must betaken with a full glass of water. Be sure to follow direc-tions for the best way to take the drug that is prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nAntimalarial drugs may cause lightheadedness,\\ndizziness , blurred vision and other vision changes. Any-\\none who takes these drugs should not drive, use machinesor do anything else thatmight be dangerous until theyhave found out how the drugs affect them.\\nThe antimalarial drug mefloquine (Lariam) has\\nreceived attention because of reports that it causes panicattacks, hallucinations ,anxiety , depression, paranoia ,\\nand other mental and mood changes, sometimes lastingfor months after the last dose. A study published in 1996in the British Medical Journal noted that about one in 140\\ntravelers who take the drug may have mental or moodchanges severe enough to interfere with normal activities.This compares to about one in 1,100 patients who havesuch reactions to the antimalarial drug chloroquine. Any-one who has unexplained anxiety, depression, restless-ness, confusion, or other troubling mental or moodchanges after taking mefloquine should call a physician\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 286Antimalarial drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 286'),\n",

Switching to a different antimalarial drug may\\nbe an alternative and can allow the side effects to stop.\\nAnyone taking antimalarial drugs to prevent malaria\\nwho develops a fever or flu-like symptoms while taking\\nthe medicine or within two to three months after travel-ing to an area where malaria is common should call aphysician immediately.\\nIf the medicine is being taken to treat malaria, and\\nsymptoms stay the same or get worse, check with thephysician who prescribed the medicine.\\nPatients who take this medicine over a long time\\nneed to have a physician check them periodically forunwanted side effects.\\nBabies and children are especially sensitive to the\\nantimalarial drug chloroquine. Not only are they morelikely to have side effects from the medicine, but they arealso at greater risk of being harmed by an overdose. Asingle 300-mg tablet could kill a small child. Keep this\\nmedicine out of the reach of children. Use safety vials.\\nSpecial conditions\\nPeople with certain medical conditions or who are\\ntaking certain other medicines can have problems ifthey take antimalarial drugs. Before taking these drugs,be sure to let the physician know about any of theseconditions:\\nALLERGIES. Anyone who has had unusual reac-\\ntions to antimalarial drugs or related medicines in thepast should let his or her physician know before takingthe drugs again. The physician should also be toldabout any allergies to foods, dyes, preservatives, or\\nother substances.\\nPREGNANCY. In laboratory animal studies, some\\nantimalarial drugs cause birth defects . But it is also\\nrisky for a pregnant woman to get malaria. Untreatedmalaria can cause premature birth, stillbirth , and mis-\\ncarriage . When given in low doses to prevent malaria,\\nantimalarial drugs have not been reported to cause birthdefects in humans. If possible, pregnant women shouldavoid traveling to areas where they could get malaria. Iftravel is necessary, women who are pregnant or who maybecome pregnant should check with their physiciansabout the use of antimalarial drugs.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Some antimalarial drugs pass into\\nbreast milk. Although no problems have been reported innursing babies whose mothers took antimalarial drugs,babies and young children are particularly sensitive tosome of these drugs. Women who are breastfeedingshould check with their physicians before using anti-malarial drugs.OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS. Before using anti-\\nmalarial drugs, people who have any of these medicalproblems (or have had them in the past) should makesure their physicians are aware of their conditions:\\n• blood disease\\n• liver disease\\n• nerve or brain disease or disorder, including seizures\\n(convulsions)\\n• past or current mental disorder\\n• stomach or intestinal disease\\n• deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehy-\\ndrogenase (G6PD), which is important in the break-down of sugar in the body\\n• deficiency of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinu-\\ncleotide (NADH) methemoglobin reductase\\n• psoriasis\\n• heart disease• family or personal history of the genetic condition fav-\\nism (a hereditary allergic condition)\\n• family or personal history of hemolytic anemia , a con-\\ndition in which red blood cells are destroyed\\n• purpura\\n• hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)\\n• blackwater fever (a serious complication of one type of\\nmalaria)\\n• myasthenia gravis (a disease of the nerves and muscles)\\nUSE OF CERTAIN MEDICINES.

Nausea, vomiting, dizziness ,\\nincreased sensitivity to light and sound, and other symp-toms may accompany the pain. The attacks may last forseveral hours or for a day or more and may come as oftenas several times a week. Some people who get migraineheadaches have warning signals before the headachesbegin, such as restlessness, tingling in an arm or leg, orseeing patterns of flashing lights. This set of signals iscalled an aura. The antimigraine drugs discussed in thissection are meant to be taken as soon as the pain begins,to relieve the pain and other symptoms. Other types ofdrugs, such as antiseizure medicines, antidepressants,calcium channel blockers and beta blockers , are some-\\ntimes prescribed to prevent attacks in people with verysevere or frequent migraines.\\nDescription\\nMigraine is thought to be caused by electrical and\\nchemical imbalances in certain parts of the brain. Theseimbalances affect the blood vessels in the brain—firsttightening them up, then widening them. As the blood ves-sels widen, they stimulate the release of chemicals thatincrease sensitivity to pain and cause inflammation andswelling. Antimigraine drugs are believed to work by cor-recting the imbalances and by tightening the blood vessels.\\nExamples of drugs in this group are ergotamine\\n(Cafergot), naratriptan (Amerge), sumatriptan (Imitrex),rizatriptan (Maxalt) and zolmitriptan (Zomig). Methy-sergide maleate (Sansert) may be used by patients whoseheadaches are not controlled by other drugs, while somepatients do well on other drugs. For example, combina-tions or ergotamine and caffeine may be very effective.\\nThe caffeine acts by constricting blood vessels to relievethe headache . Sometimes, an analgesic such as aceta-\\nminophen , caffeine, and a barbiturate which acts as a\\nsedative, are combined, as in Fioricet and similar com-pounds. These medicines are available only with a physi-cian’s prescription and come in several forms. Ergota-mine is available as tablets and rectal suppositories;sumatriptan as tablets, injections, and nasal spray; andzolmitriptan as tablets.\\nAntimigraine drugs are used to treat headaches once\\nthey have started. These drugs should not be taken to pre-vent headaches.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of drug.\\nTypical recommended dosages for adults are given belowfor each type of drug.Ergotamine\\nTake at the first sign of a migraine attack. Patients\\nwho get warning signals (aura) may take the drug as soonas they know a headache is coming.\\nTABLETS. No more than six tablets for any single\\nattack.\\nNo more than 10 tablets per week.\\nSUPPOSITORIES. No more than two suppositories\\nfor any single attack.\\nNo more than five suppositories per week.\\nNaratriptan\\nTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms\\nbegin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as notall auras result in a migraine.\\nTABLETS. Usual dose is one 1-mg tablet taken with\\nwater or other liquid.\\nDoses of 2.5-mg may be used, but they may cause\\nmore side effects.\\nIf the headache returns or if there is only partial\\nresponse, the dose may be repeated once after four hours,for a maximum dose of 5 mg in a 24-hour period. Largerdoses do not seem to offer any benefit.\\nSumatriptan\\nTake as soon as pain or other migraine symptoms\\nbegin. Also effective if taken any time during an attack.Do not take the drug until the pain actually starts as notall auras result in a migraine.\\nTABLETS. Usual dose is one 25-mg tablet, taken with\\nwater or other liquid.\\nDoses should be spaced at least two hours apart.Anyone with liver disease should consult with a\\nphysician for proper dosing.\\nINJECTIONS.

Autoantibodies are proteins built by the\\nbody, but instead of guarding against foreign material(including bacteria, viruses, and fungi) as normal anti-bodies do, they attack the body’s own cells.\\nAutoimmune and rheumatic diseases can be difficult\\nto diagnose. People with the same disease can have verydifferent symptoms. A helpful strategy in the diagnosisof these diseases is to find and identify an autoantibodyin the person’s blood.\\nThe antinuclear antibody test looks for a group of\\nautoantibodies that attack substances found in the center(nucleus) of all cells. It is useful as a screen for manyautoantibodies associated with diseases that affect theentire body (systemic diseases).\\nThis test is particularly useful when diagnosing a\\nperson with symptoms of SLE, an illness that affectsmany body organs and tissues. If the test is negative, it isunlikely that the person has SLE; if the test is positive,more tests are done to confirm whether the person hasSLE or another related disease. Other diseases, such asscleroderma ,Sjögren’s syndrome ,Raynaud’s disease ,\\nrheumatoid arthritis , and autoimmune hepatitis, often\\nhave a positive test for antinuclear antibodies.\\nDescription\\nFive to 10 mL of blood is needed for this test. The\\nantinuclear antibody test is done by adding a person’sserum to commercial cells mounted on a microscopeslide. If antinuclear antibodies are in the serum, they bindto the nuclei of cells on the slide. Next, a second anti-body is added to the mixture. This antibody is “tagged”with a fluorescent dye so that it can be seen. The secondantibody attaches to any antibodies and cells boundtogether and, because of the fluorescent “tag,” the areaswith antinuclear antibodies seem to glow, or fluoresce,when the slide is viewed under an ultraviolet microscope.\\nIf fluorescent cells are seen, the test is positive.\\nWhen positive, the serum is diluted, or titered, and thetest done again. These steps are repeated until the serumis so dilute it no longer gives a positive result. The lastdilution that shows fluorescence is the titer reported.\\nThe pattern of fluorescence within the cells gives the\\nphysician clues as to what the disease might be. The testresult includes the titer and the pattern.\\nThis test is also called the fluorescent antinuclear\\nantibody test or FANA. Results are available within oneto three days.\\nPreparation\\nNo special preparations or diet changes are required\\nbefore a person undergoes an antinuclear antibody test.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 294Antinuclear antibody testGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 294'),\n",

Parkinson’s disease is the mostcommon form of parkinsonism and is seen more fre-quently with advancing age. Other forms of the disordermay result from viral infections, environmental toxins,carbon monoxide poisoning , and the effects of treat-\\nment with antipsychotic drugs .\\nThe immediate cause of Parkinson’s disease or\\nParkinsonian-like syndrome is the lack of the neurotrans-mitter dopamine in the brain. Drug therapy may take sev-eral forms, including replacement of dopamine, inhibitionof dopamine metabolism to increase the effects of thedopamine already present, or sensitization of dopaminereceptors. Drugs may be used singly or in combination.\\nDescription\\nLevodopa (Larodopa) is the mainstay of Parkinson’s\\ntreatment. The drug crosses the blood-brain barrier, and isconverted to dopamine. The drug may be administeredalone, or in combination with carbidopa (Lodosyn) which\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 295Antiparkinson drugsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 295'),\n",

The limitation of levodopa or levodopa-carbidopatherapy is that after approximately two years of treatment,the drugs cease to work reliably. This has been termed the“on-off phenomenon.” Additional treatment strategieshave been developed to retard the progression of Parkin-sonism, or to find alternative approaches to treatment.\\nAnticholinergic drugs reduce some of the symptoms\\nof Parkinsonism, and reduce the reuptake of dopamine,thereby sustaining the activity of the natural neurohor-mone. They may be effective in all stages of the disease.All drugs with anticholinergic properties, the naturallyoccurring belladonna alkaloids (atropine, scopolamine,hyoscyamine), some antihistamines with anticholinergic\\nproperties, and synthetics such as benztropin (Cogentin),procyclidine (Kemadrin) and biperiden (Akineton) aremembers of this group. Although the anticholinergicdrugs have only limited activity against Parkinson’s dis-ease, they are useful in the early stages, and may beadjuncts to levodopa as the disease progresses.\\nAmantadine (Symmetrel), was developed for pre-\\nvention of influenza virus infection, but has anti-Parkin-\\nsonian properties. Its mechanism of action is not known.\\nBromocriptine (Parlodel) is a prolactin inhibitor,\\nwhich is used for a variety of indications includingamenorrhea/galactorrhea, female infertility , and\\nacromegaly. It appears to work by direct stimulation ofthe dopamine receptors. Bromocriptine is used as a lateadjunct to levodopa therapy, and may permit reduction inlevodopa dosage. Pergolide (Permax) is similar tobromocriptine, but has not been studied as extensively inParkinson’s disease.\\nEntacapone (Comtan) appears to act by maintaining\\nlevels of dopamine through enzyme inhibition. It is usedas an adjunct to levodopa was the patient is beginning toexperience the on-off effect. Tolcapone (Tasmar) is asimilar agent, but has demonstrated the potential forinducing severe liver failure. As such, tolcapone isreserved for cases where all other adjunctive therapieshave failed or are contraindicated.Selegeline (Carbex, Eldepryl) is a selective\\nmonoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitor, however itsmechanism of action in Parkinsonism is unclear, sinceother drugs with MAO-B inhibition have failed to showsimilar anti-Parkinsonian effects. Selegeline is used pri-marily as an adjunct to levodopa, although some studieshave indicated that the drug may be useful in the earlystages of Parkinsonism, and may delay the progressionof the disease.\\nPramipexole (Mirapex) and ropinirole (Requip) are\\nbelieved to act by direct stimulation of the dopamine recep-tors in the brain. They may be used alone in early Parkison’sdisease, or as adjuncts to levodopa in advanced stages.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosages of anti-Parkinsonian medications must be\\nhighly individualized.

Anti-psychotic drugs controlthe symptoms of psychosis, and in many cases are effec-tive in controlling the symptoms of other disorders thatmay lead to psychosis, including bipolar mood disorder(formerly termed manic-depressive), in which the patientcycles from severe depression to feelings of extremeexcitation. This class of drugs is primarily composed ofthe major tranquilizers; however, lithium carbonate, adrug that is largely specific to bipolar mood disorder, iscommonly classified among the antipsychotic agents.\\nDescription\\nThe antipsychotic agents may be divided by chemi-\\ncal class. The phenothiazines are the oldest group, andinclude chlorpromazine (Thorazine), mesoridazine (Ser-entil), prochlorperazine (Compazine), and thioridazine(Mellaril). These drugs are essentially similar in actionand adverse effects. They may also be used as anti-emet-ics, although prochlorperazine is the drug most oftenused for this indication.\\nThe phenylbutylpiperadines are haloperidol (Haldol)\\nand pimozide (Orap). They find primary use in control ofTourette’s syndrome. Haloperidol has been extremelyuseful in controlling aggressive behavior.\\nThe debenzapine derivatives, clozapine (Clozaril),\\nloxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa) and quetiap-ine (Seroquel), have been effective in controlling psy-chotic symptoms that have not been responsive to otherclasses of drugs.\\nThe benzisoxidil group is composed of resperidone\\n(Resperidal) and ziprasidone (Geodon). Resperidone hasbeen found useful for controlling bipolar mood disorder,while ziprasidone is used primarily as second-line treat-ment for schizophrenia.In addition to these drugs, the class of antipsychotic\\nagents includes lithium carbonate (Eskalith, Lithonate),which is used for control of bipolar mood disorder, andthiothixene (Navane), which is used in the treatment ofpsychosis.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDose varies with the drug, condition being treated,\\nand patient response. See specific references.\\nPrecautions\\nNeuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is a\\nrare, idiosyncratic combination of extra-pyramidal symp-toms (EPS), hyperthermia, and autonomic disturbance.Onset may be hours to months after drug initiation, butonce started, proceeds rapidly over 24 to 72 hours. It ismost commonly associated with haloperidol, long-actingfluphenazine, but has occurred with thiothixene, thiori-dazine, and clozapine, and may occur with other agents.NMS is potentially fatal, and requires intensive sympto-matic treatment and immediate discontinuation of neu-roleptic treatment. There is no established treatment.Most patients who develop NMS will have the sameproblem if the drug is restarted.\\nTardive dyskinesia (TD). Tardive dyskinesia is a\\nsyndrome of involuntary movements that may appear inpatients treated with neuroleptic drugs. Although preva-lence of TD appears highest among the elderly, especial-ly women, it is impossible to predict which patients arelikely to develop the syndrome. Both the risk of develop-ing TD and the likelihood that it will become irreversibleare increased with higher doses and longer periods oftreatment. The syndrome can develop after short treat-ment periods at low doses. Anticholinergic agents mayworsen these effects. Clozapine has occasionally beenuseful in controlling the TD caused by other antipsychot-ic drugs.\\nAgranulocytosis has been associated with clozapine.\\nThis is a potentially fatal reaction, but can be preventedwith careful monitoring of the white blood count . There\\nare no well-established risk factors for developing agran-ulocytosis, and so all patients treated with this drug mustfollow the clozapine Patient Management System.

Uretsky, PharmD\\nAntipsychotic drugs, atypical\\nDefinition\\nThe atypical antipsychotic agents, sometimes called\\nthe “novel” antipsychotic agents are a group of drugswhich are different chemically from the older drugs usedto treat psychosis . The “conventional” antipsychotic\\ndrugs are classified by their chemical structures as the\\nphenothiazines, thioxanthines (which are chemicallyvery similar to the phenothiazines), butyrophenones,diphenylbutylpiperadines and the indolones. All of theatypical antipsychotic agents are chemically classified asdibenzepines. They are considered atypical or novel\\nbecause they have different side effects from the conven-tional antipsychotic agents. The atypical drugs are farless likely to cause extra-pyrammidal side-effects(EPS),drug induced involuntary movements, than are the olderdrugs. The atypical antipsychotic drugs may also beeffective in some cases that are resistant to older drugs.\\nThe drugs in this group are clozapine (Clozaril),\\nloxapine (Loxitane), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and quetiap-ine (Seroquel).\\nPurpose\\nThe antipsychotic drugs are used to treat severe\\nemotional disorders. Although there may be differentnames for these disorders, depending on severity andhow long the symptoms last, psychotic disorders allcause at least one of the following symptoms:\\n• delusions\\n•hallucinations\\n• disorganized speech• grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior\\nLoxapine has also been used to treat anxiety with\\nmental depression.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dose depends on the drug, the\\npatient, and the condition being treated. The normalpractice is to start each patient at a low dose, and gradu-ally increase the dose until a satisfactory response isachieved.

The best known of this group is HIV , humanimmunodeficiency virus, the causative agent of AIDS .\\nPurpose\\nAntiretroviral agents are virustatic agents which\\nblock steps in the replication of the virus. The drugs arenot curative; however continued use of drugs, particular-ly in multi-drug regimens, significantly slows diseaseprogression.\\nDescription\\nThere are three main types of antiretroviral drugs,\\nalthough only two steps in the viral replications processare blocked. Nucleoside analogs, or nucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), such as didanosine (ddI,Videx), lamivudine (3TC, Epivir), stavudine (d4T, Zerit),zalcitabine (ddC, Hivid), and zidovudine (AZT, Retrovir),act by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase.Because a retrovirus is composed of RNA, the virus mustmake a DNA strand in order to replicate itself. Reversetranscriptase is an enzyme that is essential to making theDNA copy. The nucleoside reverse transcriptaseinhibitors are incorporated into the DNA strand. This is afaulty DNA molecule which is incapable of reproducing.\\nThe non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase in-\\nhibitors (NNRTIs), such as delavirdine (Rescriptor),\\nloviride, and nevirapine (Viramune) act by bindingdirectly to the reverse transcriptase molecule, inhibitingits activity.\\nProtease inhibitors , such as indinavir (Crixivan),\\nnelfinavir (Viracept), ritonavir (Norvir), and saquinavir(Invirase) act on the enzyme protease, which is essentialfor the virus to break down the proteins in infected cells.Without this essential step, the virus produces immaturecopies of itself, which are non-infectious.\\nBecause HIV mutates readily, the virus can develop\\nresistance to single drug therapy. However, treatmentwith drug combinations appears to produce a durableresponse. Proper treatment appears to slow the progres-sion of HIV infections and reduce the frequency ofopportunistic infections.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDoses must be individualized based on the patient,\\nand use of interacting drugs. The optimum combinationsof antiretroviral drugs have not been determined, nor isthere agreement on the stage of infection at which to starttreatment.\\nPrecautions\\nAlthough the antiretroviral drugs fall into three\\ngroups, each drug has a unique pattern of adverse effectsand drug interactions. Since the drugs are used in variouscombinations, the frequency and severity of adverseeffects will vary with the combination. Although mostdrug combinations show a higher rate of adverse eventsthat single drug therapy, some patterns are not pre-dictable. For example, indinavir has been reported tocause insomnia in 3% of patients, however, when used\\nin combination with zidovudine, only 1.5% of patientscomplained of sleep difficulties.\\nThe most severe adverse effects associated with the\\nprotease inhibitors are renal and hepatic toxicity.

Itis classified as an auto-immune disease, because the dis-ease is caused by the body’s own immune system actingagainst the body itself. Symptoms include painful, stiff,swollen joints, fever ,fatigue , and loss of appetite.\\nIn recent years, there has been a change in attitude\\nconcerning the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Physi-cians now use Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs(DMARDs) early in the history of the disease and areless inclined to wait for crippling stages before resortingto the more potent drugs. Fuller understanding of theside-effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs(NSAIDs) has also stimulated reliance on other types ofantirheumatic drugs.\\nDescription\\nThe major classes of antirheumatic drugs include:\\n• Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs.\\nDrugs belonging to this class bring symptomatic reliefof both inflammation and pain, but have a limited effect\\non the progressive bone and cartilage loss associatedwith rheumatoid arthritis. They act by slowing thebody’s production of prostaglandins. Common NSAIDsinclude: ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin or Advil), naproxen(Naprosyn, Aleve) and indomethacin(Indocin).\\n•Corticosteroids . These drugs are very powerful anti-\\ninflammatory agents. They are the synthetic analogs ofcortisone, produced by the body. Corticosteroids areused to reduce inflammation and suppress activity ofthe immune system. The most commonly prescribedare prednisone and dexamethasone.\\n• Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (DMARDs).\\nDMARDs influence the disease process itself and do notonly treat symptoms, hence their name. DMARDs alsohave anti-inflammatory effects, and most were borrowedfrom the treatment of other diseases, such as cancer and\\nmalaria . Antimalarials DMARDs include chloroquine\\n(Aralen) and hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil). PowerfulDMARDs include: methotrexate (Rheumatrex), sul-fasalazine, cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran) andcyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), azathioprine, sulfasalazine,penicillamine, and organic gold compounds such asaurothioglucose (Solganol), gold sodium thiomalate(Aurolate) and auranofin (Ridaura).\\n• Slow-Acting Antirheumatic Drugs (SAARDs). SAARDs\\nare a special class of DMARDs and the effect of thesedrugs is slow acting and not so quickly apparent as thatof the NSAIDs. Examples are hydroxychloroquine andaurothioglucose.\\n• Immunosuppresive cytotoxic drugs. This class of drugs\\nis used if treatment with NSAIDs and SAARDs haveno effect. Immunosuppresive drugs have a stabilizingeffect on the immune system. Since the inflammationassociated with chronic arthritis is due to malfunctionsof the immune system, use of this class of drugs hasbeen shown to be beneficial for the treatment ofrheumatoid arthritis as well. Examples are: methotrex-ate, mechlorethamine, cyclophosphamide, chlorambu-cil, and azathioprine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of drug.\\nThe prescribing physician or the pharmacist provideinformation for the correct dosage. The drugs must betaken exactly as directed.\\nWhen taking methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis,\\nit should be taken only once or twice a week as pre-\\nscribed, not every day.

For practi-cal purposes, antiseptics are routinely thought of as topi-cal agents, for application to skin, mucous membranes,and inanimate objects, although a formal definitionincludes agents which are used internally, such as the uri-nary tract antiseptics.\\nPurpose\\nAntiseptics are a diverse class of drugs which are\\napplied to skin surfaces or mucous membranes for theiranti-infective effects. This may be either bacteriocidal orbacteriostatic. Their uses include cleansing of skin andwound surfaces after injury, preparation of skin surfacesprior to injections or surgical procedures, and routine disin-fection of the oral cavity as part of a program of oralhygiene . Antiseptics are also used for disinfection of inani-\\nmate objects, including instruments and furniture surfaces.\\nCommonly used antiseptics for skin cleaning include\\nbenzalkonium chloride, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophine,iodine compounds, mercury compounds, alcohol andhydrogen peroxide. Other agents which have been usedfor this purpose, but have largely been supplanted bymore effective or safer agents, include boric acid andvolatile oils such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen.)\\nChlorhexidine shows a high margin of safety when\\napplied to mucous membranes, and has been used in oralrinses and preoperative total body washes.\\nBenzalkonium chloride and hexachlorophine are used\\nprimarily as hand scrubs or face washes. Benzalkonium mayalso find application is a disinfecting agent for instruments,and in low concentration as a preservative for drugs includ-ing ophthalmic solutions. Benzalkonium chloride is inacti-vated by organic compounds, including soap, and must notbe applied to areas which have not been fully rinsed.\\nIodine compounds include tincture of iodine and\\npovidone iodine compounds. Iodine compounds have thebroadest spectrum of all topical anti-infectives, with actionagainst bacteria, fungi, viruses, spores, protozoa, andyeasts. Iodine tincture is highly effective, but its alcoholiccomponent is drying and extremely irritating when appliedto abraided (scraped or rubbed) skin. Povidone iodine, anorganic compound, is less irritating and less toxic, but notas effective. Povidone iodine has been used for handscrubs and disinfection of surgical sites. Aqueous solu-tions of iodine have also been used as antiseptic agents,but are less effective than alcoholic solutions and less con-venient to use that the povidone iodine compounds.\\nHydrogen peroxide acts through the liberation of\\noxygen gas. Although the antibacterial activity of hydro-gen peroxide is relatively weak, the liberation of oxygenbubbles produces an effervescent action, which may beuseful for wound cleansing through removal of tissuedebris. The activity of hydrogen peroxide may bereduced by the presence of blood and pus. The appropri-ate concentration of hydrogen peroxide for antiseptic useis 3%, although higher concentrations are available.\\nThimerosol (Mersol) is a mercury compound with\\nactivity against bacteria and yeasts. Prolonged use mayresult in mercury toxicity.\\nRecommended dosage\\nDosage varies with product and intended use.

Traditionally, they were used to treat stom-ach ulcers, but for this purpose they have largely beenreplaced by the acid inhibiting compoundsa, the H-2receptor blockers such as cimetidine and ranitidine andthe proton pump inhibtors such as omeprazole, lansopra-zole and rabetazole.\\nMost of the drugs used for this purpose as “anti-\\ncholinergics”, since they counteract the effects of theneurohormone acetylcholine. Some of these drugs arederived from the plant belladonna, also known as DeadlyNightshade. There is also a group of drugs with similaractivity, but not taken from plant sources. The anti-cholingergics decrease both the movements of the stom-ach and intestine, and also the secretions of stomach acidand digestive enzymes. They may be used for other pur-poses including treatment of Parkinson’s Disease , and\\nbladder urgency.

The disease can be cured with properdrug therapy, but because the bacteria may become resis-tant to any single drug, combinations of antituberculosisdrugs are used to treat tuberculosis (TB) are normallyrequired for effective treatment. At the start of the 20thCentury, tuberculosis was the most common cause ofdeath in the United States, but was laregly eliminated\\nwith better living conditions. It is most common in areasof crowding and poor ventilation, suich as crowdedurban areas and prisons. In some areas, the AIDS epi-\\ndemic has been accompanied by an increase in the preva-lence of tuberculosis.\\nSome antituberculosis drugs also are used to treat or\\nprevent other infections such as Mycobacterium avium\\ncomplex (MAC), which causes disease throughout thebodies of people with AIDS or other diseases of theimmune system.\\nDescription\\nAntituberculosis drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, capsule, liq-uid and injectable forms. Some commonly used antitu-berculosis drugs are cycloserine (Seromycin), ethambu-tol (Myambutol), ethionamide (Trecator-SC), isoniazid(Nydrazid, Laniazid), pyrazinamide, rifabutin(Mycobutin), and rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane).\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nantituberculosis drug and may be different for differentpatients. Check with the physician who prescribed themedicine or the pharmacist who filled the prescriptionfor the proper dosage. The physician may graduallyincrease the dosage during treatment. Be sure to followthe physician’s orders. Patients who are infected withHIV must usually take larger combinations of drugs for alonger period of time than is needed for patients with anunimpaired immune system.\\nSome antituberculosis drugs must be taken with\\nother drugs. If they are taken alone, they may encouragethe bacteria that cause tuberculosis to become resistant todrugs used to treat the disease. When the bacteria becomeresistant, treating the disease becomes more difficult.\\nTo clear up tuberculosis completely, antituberculosis\\ndrugs must be taken for as long as directed. This maymean taking the medicine every day for a year or two oreven longer. Symptoms may improve very quickly aftertreatment with this medicine begins. However, they may\\ncome back if the medicine is stopped too quickly. Do notstop taking the medicine just because symptoms improve.\\nBecause people may neglect to take their medication\\nfor tuberculosis, it is common to have tuberculosis centersdevelop a program of Directly Observed Therapy (DOT.)In these programs, patients come to the hospital or clinic,and take their medication in front of an observer. Theseprograms may be annoying to the patients, but are justi-fied by the risks to public health if tuberculosis germswhich have become resistant to drugs were to be spread.\\nCycloserine works best when it is at constant levels\\nin the blood. To help keep levels constant, take the medi-cine in doses spaced evenly through the day and night.Do not miss any doses.

Additionally, bismuthcompounds have been used. The primary class of drugsused for gastric acid suppression are the proton pumpinhibitors, omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole andrabeprazole. The H-2 receptor blocking agents, cimeti-dine, f amotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine have been used\\nfor this purpose, but are now more widely used for mainte-nance therapy after treatment with the proton pumpinhibitors.

In some cases, gas-\\ntric acid secretion is completely blocked for over 24 hourson a single dose. In addition to their role in treatment ofgastric ulcers, the proton pump inhibitors are used to treatsyndromes of excessive acid secretion (Zollinger-EllisonSyndrome) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\\nHistamine H-2 receptor blockers stop the action of\\nhistamine on the gastric parietal cells, inhibiting the secre-tion of gastric acid. These drugs are less effective than theproton pump inhibitors, but may achieve a 75–79% reduc-tion in acid secretion. Higher rates of acid inhibition maybe achieved when the drug is administered by the intra-venous route. The H-2 receptor blockers may also be usedto treat heartburn and hypersecretory syndromes. When\\ngiven before surgery, the H-2 receptor blockers are usefulin prevention of aspiration pneumonia .\\nSucralfate (Carafate), a substituted sugar molecule\\nwith no nutritional value, does not inhibit gastric acid, butrather, reacts with existing stomach acid to form a thickcoating that covers the surface of an ulcer, protecting theopen area from further damage. A secondary effect is toact as an inhibitor of the digestive enzyme pepsin. Sucral-fate does not bind to the normal stomach lining. The drughas been used for prevention of stress ulcers, the type\\nseen in patients exposed to physical stress such as burns\\nand surgery. It has no systemic effects.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe doses of the proton pump inhibitors and H-2\\nreceptor blockers vary depending on the drug and condi-tion being treated. Consult individual references.\\nThe dose of sucralfate for acute ulcer therapy is 1\\ngram four times a day. After the ulcer has healed, mainte-nance treatment may continue at 1 gram two times daily.\\nPrecautions\\nThe proton pump inhibitors are generally well toler-\\nated, and the most common adverse effects are diarrhea ,itching , skin rash, dizziness and headache . Muscle\\naches and a higher than normal rate of respiratory infec-tions are among the other adverse reactions reported.Omeprazole has an increased rate of fetal deaths in ani-mal studies. It is not known if these drugs are excreted inhuman milk, but because of reported adverse effects toinfants in animal studies, it is recommended that protonpump inhibitors not be used by nursing mothers.\\nThe H-2 receptor blockers vary widely in their\\nadverse effects. Although they are generally well tolerat-ed, cimetidine may cause confusion in elderly patients,and has an antiandrogenic effect that may cause sexual\\ndysfunction in males. Famotidine has been reported to\\ncause headache in 4.7% of patients. It is advisable thatmothers not take H-2 receptor blockers while nursing.\\nSucralfate is well tolerated. It is poorly absorbed,\\nand its most common side effect is constipation in 2% of\\npatients. Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, gastric discomfort,indigestion , flatulence, dry mouth , rash, pruritus (itch-\\ning), back pain , headache, dizziness, sleepiness, and ver-\\ntigo have been reported, as well as rare allergic respons-es.

Unlike antibacterial drugs, which may cover awide range of pathogens, antiviral agents tend to be nar-row in spectrum, and have limited efficacy.\\nDescription\\nExclusive of the antiretroviral agents used in HIV\\n(AIDS ) therapy, there are currently only 11 antiviral\\ndrugs available, covering four types of virus. Acyclovir(Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir (Val-trex) are effective against herpesvirus, including herpeszoster and herpes genitalis. They may also be of value ineither conditions caused by herpes, such as chickenpox\\nand shingles . These drugs are not curative, but may\\nreduce the pain of a herpes outbreak and shorten the\\nperiod of viral shedding.\\nAmantadine (Symmetrel), oseltamivir (Tamiflu),\\nrimantidine (Flumadine), and zanamivir (Relenza) areuseful in treatment of influenza virus. Amantadine,\\nrimantadine, and oseltamivir may be administeredthroughout the flu season as preventatives for patientswho cannot take influenza virus vaccine.\\nCidofovir (Vistide), foscarnet (Foscavir), and ganci-\\nclovir (Cytovene) have been beneficial in treatment ofcytomegalovirus in immunosupressed patients, primarilyHIV-positive patients and transplant recipients. Ribavirin(Virazole) is used to treat respiratory syncytial virus. Incombination with interferons, ribavirin has shown someefficacy against hepatitis C , and there have been anecdo-\\ntal reports of utility against other types of viral infections.\\nAs a class, the antivirals are not curative, and must be\\nused either prophylactically or early in the developmentof an infection. Their mechanism of action is typically toinactivate the enzymes needed for viral replication. Thiswill reduce the rate of viral growth, but will not inactivethe virus already present. Antiviral therapy must normallybe initiated within 48 hours of the onset of an infection toprovide any benefit. Drugs used for influenza may beused throughout the influenza season in high risk patients,or within 48 hours of exposure to a known carrier. Anti-herpetic agents should be used at the first signs of an out-break.

Uretsky, PharmD\\nAnxiety\\nDefinition\\nAnxiety is a multisystem response to a perceived\\nthreat or danger. It reflects a combination of biochemicalchanges in the body, the patient’s personal history andmemory, and the social situation. As far as we know, anxi-ety is a uniquely human experience. Other animals clearlyknow fear, but human anxiety involves an ability, to usememory and imagination to move backward and forwardin time, that animals do not appear to have. The anxietythat occurs in post-traumatic syndromes indicates thathuman memory is a much more complicated mental func-tion than animal memory. Moreover, a large portion ofhuman anxiety is produced by anticipation of futureevents. Without a sense of personal continuity over time,people would not have the “raw materials” of anxiety.\\nIt is important to distinguish between anxiety as a\\nfeeling or experience, and an anxiety disorder as a psy-chiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious withouthaving an anxiety disorder. Also a person facing a clearand present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con-sidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxietyfrequently occurs as a symptom in other categories ofpsychiatric disturbance.\\nDescription\\nAlthough anxiety is a commonplace experience that\\neveryone has from time to time, it is difficult to describeconcretely because it has so many different potential caus-es and degrees of intensity. Doctors sometimes categorizeanxiety as an emotion or an affect depending on whether itis being described by the person having it (emotion) or byan outside observer (affect). The word emotion is general-\\nly used for the biochemical changes and feeling state thatunderlie a person’s internal sense of anxiety. Affect is used\\nto describe the person’s emotional state from an observer’sperspective. If a doctor says that a patient has an anxiousaffect, he or she means that the patient appears nervous oranxious, or responds to others in an anxious way (forexample, the individual is shaky, tremulous, etc.).\\nAlthough anxiety is related to fear, it is not the same\\nthing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific eventor object, and the person is consciously aware of it. Mostpeople will feel fear if someone points a loaded gun atthem or if they see a tornado forming on the horizon. Theyalso will recognize that they are afraid. Anxiety, on theother hand, is often unfocused, vague, and hard to pindown to a specific cause. In this form it is called free-float-ing anxiety. Sometimes anxiety being experienced in thepresent may stem from an event or person that producedpain and fear in the past, but the anxious individual is not\\nconsciously aware of the original source of the feeling. Itis anxiety’s aspect of remoteness that makes it hard forpeople to compare their experiences of it. Whereas mostpeople will be fearful in physically dangerous situations,and can agree that fear is an appropriate response in thepresence of danger, anxiety is often triggered by objects orevents that are unique and specific to an individual. Anindividual might be anxious because of a unique meaningor memory being stimulated by present circumstances, notbecause of some immediate danger. Another individuallooking at the anxious person from the outside may betruly puzzled as to the reason for the person’s anxiety.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAnxiety can have a number of different causes. It is\\na multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’senvironment, or a response to an internal stimulus (forexample, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum-bling) resulting from a combination of general biologicaland individual psychological processes.\\nPhysical\\nIn some cases, anxiety is produced by physical respons-\\nes to stress , or by certain disease processes or medications.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 317AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 317'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 331}, page_content='THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The ner-\\nvous system of human beings is “hard-wired” to respondto dangers or threats. These responses are not subject toconscious control, and are the same in humans as inlower animals. They represent an evolutionary adaptationto the animal predators and other dangers with which allanimals, including primitive humans, had to cope. Themost familiar reaction of this type is the so-called “fight-or-flight” reaction. This response is the human organ-ism’s automatic “red alert” in a life-threatening situation.It is a state of physiological and emotional hyperarousalmarked by high muscle tension and strong feelings offear or anger. When a person has a fight-or-flight reac-tion, the level of stress hormones in their blood rises.They become more alert and attentive, their eyes dilate,their heartbeat increases, their breathing rate increases,and their digestion slows down, allowing more energy tobe available to the muscles.\\nThis emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the\\nnervous system called the autonomic nervous system, orANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-cialized part of the brainstem that is among a group ofstructures called the limbic system. The limbic systemcontrols human emotions through its connections toglands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and“higher” brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cor-tex. One problem with this arrangement is that the limbicsystem cannot tell the difference between a realisticphysical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.The hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-mones by the pituitary gland, even when there is noexternal and objective danger. A second problem iscaused by the biochemical side effects of too many “falsealarms” in the ANS. When a person responds to a realdanger, his or her body gets rid of the stress hormones byrunning away or by fighting. In modern life, however,people often have fight-or-flight reactions in situations inwhich they can neither run away nor lash out physically.As a result, their bodies have to absorb all the biochemi-cal changes of hyperarousal, rather than release them.These biochemical changes can produce anxious feel-ings, as well as muscle tension and other physical symp-toms associated with anxiety. They may even producepermanent changes in the brain, if the process occursrepeatedly. Moreover, chronic physical disorders, such ascoronary artery disease , may be worsened by anxiety,\\nas chronic hyperarousal puts undue stress on the heart,stomach, and other organs.\\nDISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp-\\ntom of certain medical conditions. Some of these dis-eases are disorders of the endocrine system, such asCushing’s syndrome (overproduction of cortisol by the\\nadrenal cortex), and include over- or underactivity of thethyroid gland. Other medical conditions that can produce\\nanxiety include respiratory distress syndrome ,mitral\\nvalve prolapse , porphyria, and chest pain caused by\\ninadequate blood supply to the heart ( angina pectoris).\\nMEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous\\nmedications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a sideeffect. They include birth control pills; some thyroid orasthma drugs; some psychotropic agents; occasionally,\\nlocal anesthetics; corticosteroids ; antihypertensive\\ndrugs ; and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like\\nflurbiprofen and ibuprofen).\\nAlthough people do not usually think of caffeine as\\na drug, it can cause anxiety-like symptoms when con-sumed in sufficient quantity. Patients who consume caf-feine rich foods and beverages, such as chocolate, cocoa,coffee, tea, or carbonated soft drinks (especially colabeverages), can sometimes lower their anxiety symptomssimply by reducing their intake of these substances.\\nWithdrawal from certain prescription drugs, primari-\\nly beta blockers and corticosteroids, can cause anxiety.\\nWithdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD ,\\ncocaine , alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety.\\nLearned associations\\nSome aspects of anxiety appear to be unavoidable\\nbyproducts of the human developmental process.Humans are unique among animals in that they spend anunusually long period of early life in a relatively helplesscondition, and a sense of helplessness can lead to anxi-ety. The extended period of human dependency on adultsmeans that people may remember, and learn to antici-pate, frightening or upsetting experiences long beforethey are capable enough to feel a sense of mastery overtheir environment. In addition, the fact that anxiety dis-\\norders often run in families indicates that children can\\nlearn unhealthy attitudes and behaviors from parents, aswell as healthy ones. Also, recurrent disorders in familiesmay indicate that there is a genetic or inherited compo-nent in some anxiety disorders. For example, there hasbeen found to be a higher rate of anxiety disorders(panic) in identical twins than in fraternal twins.\\nCHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND ANXIETY. Re-\\nsearchers in early childhood development regard anxietyin adult life as a residue of childhood memories ofdependency. Humans learn during the first year of lifethat they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur-vival depends on the care of others. It is thought that thisearly experience of helplessness underlies the most com-mon anxieties of adult life, including fear of powerless-ness and fear of being unloved. Thus, adults can be madeanxious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 318AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 318'),\n",

The psychoanalytic model gives\\nconsiderable weight to the symbolic aspect of humananxiety; examples include phobic disorders, obsessions,compulsions, and other forms of anxiety that are highlyindividualized. The length of the human maturationprocess allows many opportunities for children and ado-lescents to connect their experiences with certain objectsor events that can bring back feelings in later life. Forexample, a person who was frightened as a child by a tallman wearing glasses may feel panicky years later bysomething that reminds him of that person or experiencewithout consciously knowing why.\\nFreud thought that anxiety results from a person’s\\ninternal conflicts. According to his theory, people feelanxious when they feel torn between desires or urgestoward certain actions, on the one hand, and moralrestrictions, on the other. In some cases, the person’sanxiety may attach itself to an object that represents theinner conflict. For example, someone who feels anxiousaround money may be pulled between a desire to stealand the belief that stealing is wrong. Money becomes asymbol for the inner conflict between doing what is con-sidered right and doing what one wants.\\nPHOBIAS. Phobias are a special type of anxiety\\nreaction in which the person’s anxiety is concentrated ona specific object or situation that the person then tries toavoid. In most cases, the person’s fear is out of all pro-portion to its “cause.” Prior to the Diagnostic and Statis-\\ntical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV),\\nthese specific phobias were called simple phobias. It isestimated that 10-11% of the population will develop aphobia in the course of their lives. Some phobias, such asagoraphobia (fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear\\nof small or confined spaces), and social phobia, areshared by large numbers of people. Others are less com-mon or unique to the patient.\\nSocial and environmental stressors\\nAnxiety often has a social dimension because\\nhumans are social creatures. People frequently reportfeelings of high anxiety when they anticipate and, there-fore, fear the loss of social approval or love. Social phobiais a specific anxiety disorder that is marked by high levelsof anxiety or fear of embarrassment in social situations.\\nAnother social stressor is prejudice. People who\\nbelong to groups that are targets of bias are at higher riskfor developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, forexample, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis-\\norder among women reflects their greater social and\\neconomic vulnerability.Some controversial studies indicate that the increase\\nin violent or upsetting pictures and stories in newsreports and entertainment may raise the anxiety level ofmany people. Stress and anxiety management programsoften suggest that patients cut down their exposure toupsetting stimuli.\\nAnxiety may also be caused by environmental or\\noccupational factors. People who must live or workaround sudden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights,chemical vapors, or similar nuisances, which they cannotavoid or control, may develop heightened anxiety levels.\\nExistential anxiety\\nAnother factor that shapes human experiences of\\nanxiety is knowledge of personal mortality. Humans arethe only animals that appear to be aware of their limitedlife span. Some researchers think that awareness ofdeath influences experiences of anxiety from the time\\nthat a person is old enough to understand death.\\nSymptoms of anxiety\\nIn order to understand the diagnosis and treatment of\\nanxiety, it is helpful to have a basic understanding of itssymptoms.\\nSOMATIC. The somatic or physical symptoms of\\nanxiety include headaches, dizziness or lightheadedness,\\nnausea and/or vomiting, diarrhea , tingling, pale com-\\nplexion, sweating, numbness, difficulty in breathing, andsensations of tightness in the chest, neck, shoulders, orhands. These symptoms are produced by the hormonal,muscular, and cardiovascular reactions involved in thefight-or-flight reaction.\\nBEHAVIORAL. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety\\ninclude pacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyper-ventilation, pressured speech, hand wringing, or fingertapping.\\nCOGNITIVE. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include\\nrecurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor-bid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion, orinability to concentrate.\\nEMOTIONAL. Feeling states associated with anxiety\\ninclude tension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or“keyed up,” and feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.\\nDEFENSE MECHANISMS. In psychoanalytic theory,\\nthe symptoms of anxiety in humans may arise from oractivate a number of unconscious defense mechanisms.Because of these defenses, it is possible for a person tobe anxious without being consciously aware of it orappearing anxious to others. These psychological defens-es include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 319AnxietyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 319'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 333}, page_content='• Repression. The person pushes anxious thoughts or\\nideas out of conscious awareness.\\n• Displacement. Anxiety from one source is attached to a\\ndifferent object or event. Phobias are an example of themechanism of displacement in psychoanalytic theory.\\n• Rationalization. The person justifies the anxious feel-\\nings by saying that any normal person would feel anx-ious in their situation.\\n• Somatization. The anxiety emerges in the form of phys-\\nical complaints and illnesses, such as recurrentheadaches, stomach upsets, or muscle and joint pain.\\n• Delusion formation. The person converts anxious feel-\\nings into conspiracy theories or similar ideas withoutreality testing. Delusion formation can involve groupsas well as individuals.\\nOther theorists attribute some drug addiction to the\\ndesire to relieve symptoms of anxiety. Most addictions,they argue, originate in the use of mood-altering sub-stances or behaviors to “medicate” anxious feelings.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anxiety is difficult and complex\\nbecause of the variety of its causes and the highly personal-ized and individualized nature of its symptom formation.There are no medical tests that can be used to diagnoseanxiety by itself. When a doctor examines an anxiouspatient, he or she will first rule out physical conditions anddiseases that have anxiety as a symptom. Apart from theseexclusions, the physical examination is usually inconclu-\\nsive. Some anxious patients may have their blood pressureor pulse rate affected by anxiety, or may look pale or per-spire heavily, but others may appear physically completelynormal. The doctor will then take the patient’s medication,dietary, and occupational history to see if they are takingprescription drugs that might cause anxiety, if they areabusing alcohol or mood-altering drugs, if they are con-suming large amounts of caffeine, or if their workplace isnoisy or dangerous. In most cases, the most importantsource of diagnostic information is the patient’s psycholog-ical and social history. The doctor may administer a briefpsychological test to help evaluate the intensity of thepatient’s anxiety and some of its features. Some tests thatare often given include the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and theAnxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS). Many doc-tors will check a number of chemical factors in the blood,such as the level of thyroid hormone and blood sugar.\\nTreatment\\nNot all patients with anxiety require treatment, but\\nfor more severe cases, treatment is recommended.Because anxiety often has more than one cause and is\\nexperienced in highly individual ways, its treatment usu-ally requires more than one type of therapy. In addition,there is no way to tell in advance how patients willrespond to a specific drug or therapy. Sometimes the doc-tor will need to try different medications or methods oftreatment before finding the best combination for theparticular patient. It usually takes about six to eightweeks for the doctor to evaluate the effectiveness of atreatment regimen.\\nMedications\\nMedications are often prescribed to relieve the phys-\\nical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most agentswork by counteracting the biochemical and muscularchanges involved in the fight-or-flight reaction. Somework directly on the chemicals in the brain that arethought to underlie the anxiety.\\nANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called\\ntranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi-\\nazepines or barbiturates . Barbiturates, once commonly\\nused, are now rarely used in clinical practice. Barbitu-rates work by slowing down the transmission of nerveimpulses from the brain to other parts of the body. Theyinclude such drugs as phenobarbital (Luminal) and pen-tobarbital (Nembutal). Benzodiazepines work by relax-ing the skeletal muscles and calming the limbic system.They include such drugs as chlordiazepoxide (Librium)and diazepam (Valium). Both barbiturates and benzodi-azepines are potentially habit-forming and may causewithdrawal symptoms, but benzodiazepines are far lesslikely than barbiturates to cause physical dependency.Both drugs also increase the effects of alcohol andshould never be taken in combination with it.\\nTwo other types of anxiolytic medications include\\nmeprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, andbuspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that appearsto work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s ownemotion-regulating brain chemicals. Buspirone has sever-al advantages over other anxiolytics. It does not causedependence problems, does not interact with alcohol, anddoes not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operatemachinery. However, buspirone is not effective againstcertain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder.\\nANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. For some\\nanxiety disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disor-\\nderand panic type anxiety, a type of drugs used to treat\\ndepression, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs; such as Prozac and Paxil), are the treatment ofchoice. Because anxiety often coexists with symptoms ofdepression, many doctors prescribe antidepressant med-ications for anxious/depressed patients.

They includedrugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin).Beta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post-traumatic anxiety symptoms. More commonly, the beta-blockers are given to patients with a mild form of socialphobic anxiety, such as fear of public speaking.\\nPsychotherapy\\nMost patients with anxiety will be given some form of\\npsychotherapy along with medications. Many patientsbenefit from insight-oriented therapies, which aredesigned to help them uncover unconscious conflicts anddefense mechanisms in order to understand how theirsymptoms developed. Patients who are extremely anxiousmay benefit from supportive psychotherapy, which aims atsymptom reduction rather than personality restructuring.\\nTwo newer approaches that work well with anxious\\npatients are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and\\nrelaxation training. In CBT, the patient is taught to identifythe thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her anxi-ety, and to view them more realistically. In the behavioralpart of the program, the patient is exposed to the anxiety-provoking object, situation, or internal stimulus (like arapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she is desen-sitized to it. Relaxation training, which is sometimescalled anxiety management training, includes breathingexercises and similar techniques intended to help thepatient prevent hyperventilation and relieve the muscletension associated with the fight-or-flight reaction. BothCBT and relaxation training can be used in group therapy\\nas well as individual treatment. In addition to CBT, sup-port groups are often helpful to anxious patients, becausethey provide a social network and lessen the embarrass-ment that often accompanies anxiety symptoms.\\nPsychosurgery\\nSurgery on the brain is very rarely recommended for\\npatients with anxiety; however, some patients with severecases of obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) havebeen helped by an operation on a part of the brain that isinvolved in OCD. Normally, this operation is attemptedafter all other treatments have failed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of\\napproaches. Meditation and mindfulness training arethought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-\\nder. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients\\nbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-tem. Yoga , aikido, t’ai chi , and dance therapy help patients\\nwork with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.\\nHomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine\\napproach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based onother associated symptoms and the patient’s general con-stitution. Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockageof qi, or vital force, inside the patient’s body that is most\\nlikely to affect the lung and large intestine meridian flow.The practitioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupunc-\\nture point locations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi\\nand rebalance the entire system in relation to the lungand large intestine.\\nAromatherapy using essential oils can also be ben-\\neficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-trols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-vous system.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for resolution of anxiety depends on\\nthe specific disorder and a wide variety of factors,including the patient’s age, sex, general health, living sit-uation, belief system, social support network, andresponses to different anxiolytic medications and formsof therapy.\\nPrevention\\nHumans have significant control over thoughts, and,\\ntherefore, may learn ways of preventing anxiety bychanging irrational ideas and beliefs. Humans also havesome power over anxiety arising from social and envi-ronmental conditions. Other forms of anxiety, however,are built into the human organism and its life cycle, andcannot be prevented or eliminated.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Anxiety Disorders.” In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders. 4th ed.

Some phobias concern activities or objects thatinvolve some risk (for example, flying or driving) butmany are focused on harmless animals or other objects.Social phobia involves a fear of being humiliated,judged, or scrutinized. It manifests itself as a fear ofperforming certain functions in the presence of others,such as public speaking or using public lavatories.\\n• Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This disorder is\\nmarked by unwanted, intrusive, persistent thoughts orrepetitive behaviors that reflect the patient’s anxiety orattempts to control it. It affects between 2-3% of thepopulation and is much more common than was previ-ously thought.\\n•Stress disorders. These include post-traumatic stress\\ndisorder (PTSD) and acute stress disorder .

These\\ninclude general medical conditions or substance abuse.\\n• Anxiety disorder not otherwise specified. This last cate-\\ngory is not a separate type of disorder, but is included tocover symptoms that do not meet the specific DSM-IV\\ncriteria for other anxiety disorders.\\nAll DSM-IV anxiety disorder diagnoses include a\\ncriterion of severity. The anxiety must be severe enoughto interfere significantly with the patient’s occupationalor educational functioning, social activities or close rela-tionships, and other customary activities.\\nThe anxiety disorders vary widely in their frequency\\nof occurrence in the general population, age of onset,family patterns, and gender distribution. The stress disor-ders and anxiety disorders caused by medical conditionsor substance abuse are less age- and gender-specific.Whereas OCD affects males and females equally, GAD,panic disorder, and specific phobias all affect womenmore frequently than men. GAD and panic disorders aremore likely to develop in young adults, while phobiasand OCD can begin in childhood.\\nAnxiety disorders in children and adolescents\\nDSM-IV defines one anxiety disorder as specific to\\nchildren, namely, separation anxiety disorder. This disor-der is defined as anxiety regarding separation from homeor family that is excessive or inappropriate for the child’sage. In some children, separation anxiety takes the formof school avoidance.Children and adolescents can also be diagnosed with\\npanic disorder, phobias, generalized anxiety disorder,and the post- traumatic stress syndromes.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of anxiety include a variety of individual\\nand general social factors, and may produce physical,cognitive, emotional, or behavioral symptoms. Thepatient’s ethnic or cultural background may also influ-ence his or her vulnerability to certain forms of anxiety.Genetic factors that lead to biochemical abnormalitiesmay also play a role.\\nAnxiety in children may be caused by suffering from\\nabuse, as well as by the factors that cause anxiety in adults.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of anxiety disorders is complicated by\\nthe variety of causes of anxiety and the range of disor-ders that may include anxiety as a symptom. Manypatients who suffer from anxiety disorders have featuresor symptoms of more than one disorder. Patients whoseanxiety is accounted for by another psychic disorder,such as schizophrenia or major depression, are not diag-\\nnosed with an anxiety disorder. A doctor examining ananxious patient will usually begin by ruling out diseasesthat are known to cause anxiety and then proceed to takethe patient’s medication history, in order to exclude sideeffects of prescription drugs. Most doctors will ask aboutcaffeine consumption to see if the patient’s dietary habits\\nare a factor. The patient’s work and family situation willalso be discussed. Laboratory tests for blood sugar andthyroid function are also common\\nDiagnostic testing for anxiety\\nThere are no laboratory tests that can diagnose anxi-\\nety, although the doctor may order some specific tests torule out disease conditions. Although there is no psychi-atric test that can provide definite diagnoses of anxiety dis-orders, there are several short-answer interviews or symp-tom inventories that doctors can use to evaluate the inten-sity of a patient’s anxiety and some of its associated fea-tures. These measures include the Hamilton Anxiety Scaleand the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).\\nTreatment\\nFor relatively mild anxiety disorders, psychotherapy\\nalone may suffice.

Because of the\\nvariety of medications and treatment approaches that areused to treat anxiety disorders, the doctor cannot predictin advance which combination will be most helpful to aspecific patient. In many cases the doctor will need to trya new medication or treatment over a six- to eight-weekperiod in order to assess its effectiveness. Treatment trialsdo not necessarily mean that the patient cannot be helpedor that the doctor is incompetent.\\nAlthough anxiety disorders are not always easy to\\ndiagnose, there are several reasons why it is important forpatients with severe anxiety symptoms to get help. Anxi-ety doesn’t always go away by itself; it often progresses topanic attacks, phobias, and episodes of depression.Untreated anxiety disorders may eventually lead to a diag-nosis of major depression, or interfere with the patient’seducation or ability to keep a job. In addition, many anx-ious patients develop addictions to drugs or alcohol whenthey try to “medicate” their symptoms. Moreover, sincechildren learn ways of coping with anxiety from their par-ents, adults who get help for anxiety disorders are in a bet-ter position to help their families cope with factors thatlead to anxiety than those who remain untreated.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for anxiety cover a variety of\\napproaches. Meditation and mindfulness training are\\nthought beneficial to patients with phobias and panic disor-der. Hydrotherapy is useful to some anxious patients\\nbecause it promotes general relaxation of the nervous sys-tem. Yoga , aikido, t’ai chi , and dance therapy help patients\\nwork with the physical, as well as the emotional, tensionsthat either promote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.\\nHomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine\\napproach anxiety as a symptom of a systemic disorder.Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based on otherassociated symptoms and the patient’s general constitution.Chinese medicine regards anxiety as a blockage of qi,o r\\nvital force, inside the patient’s body that is most likely toaffect the lung and large intestine meridian flow. The practi-tioner of Chinese medicine chooses acupuncture point\\nlocations and/or herbal therapy to move the qi and rebalancethe entire system in relation to the lung and large intestine.\\nAromatherapy using essential oils can also be ben-\\neficial in treating patients with anxiety. The oils godirectly to the brain via the olfactory nerve (which con-trols smell) and can have direct affect on calming the ner-vous system.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for recovery depends on the specific\\ndisorder, the severity of the patient’s symptoms, the spe-KEY TERMS\\nAgoraphobia —Abnormal anxiety regarding public\\nplaces or situations from which the patient maywish to flee or in which he or she would be help-less in the event of a panic attack.\\nCompulsion —A repetitive or ritualistic behavior\\nthat a person performs to reduce anxiety.

The aorta, which can developthese abnormal bulges, is the large blood vessel that car-ries oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest ofthe body.\\nDescription\\nThe aorta carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, and\\nis therefore called an artery. Because the aorta is anartery, its walls are made of up three layers; a thin innerlayer, a muscular middle layer (that gives the vessel itsflexibility under pressure from the filling blood), and afiber-like outer layer that gives the vessel strength to notburst when the heart pumps blood to the body.\\nAortic aneurysms occur when a weakness develops\\nin part of the wall of the aorta; three basic types are usual-ly found. If all three layers of the vessel are affected andweakness develops along an extended area of the vessel,the weakened area will appear as a large, bulging regionof blood vessel; this is called a fusiform aneurysm. Ifweakness develops between the inner and outer layers ofthe aortic wall, a bulge results as blood from the interiorof the vessel is pushed around the damaged region in thewall and collects between these layers. This is called adissecting aneurysm because one layer is “dissected” orseparated from another. If damage occurs to only the mid-dle (muscular) layer of the vessel, a sack-like bulge canform; therefore, this is a saccular aneurysm.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic aneurysms occur in different portions of the\\naorta, which begins in the chest (at the heart) and travelsdownward through the abdomen. Aneurysms found inthe region of the aorta within the chest are called thoracicaortic aneurysms. Aneurysms that occur in the part of theaorta within the abdomen are called abdominal aorticaneurysms.\\nThoracic aortic aneurysms do not usually produce\\nany noticeable symptoms. However, as the aneurysmbecomes larger, chest, shoulder, neck, lower back, orabdominal pain can result. Abdominal aortic aneurysms\\noccur more often in men, and these aneurysms can causepain in the lower back, hips, and abdomen. A painfulabdominal aortic aneurysm usually means that theaneurysm could burst very soon.\\nMost abdominal aortic aneurysms are caused by\\natherosclerosis , a condition caused when fat (mostly\\ncholesterol) carried in the blood builds up in the innerwall of the aorta. As more and more fat attaches to theaortic wall, the wall itself becomes abnormally weak andoften results in an aneurysm or bulge.\\nAortic aneurysms are also caused by a breakdown of\\nthe muscular middle layer of the artery wall, by highblood pressure, by direct injury to the chest, and althoughrare, by bacteria that can infect the aorta.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 325Aortic aneurysm\\nSurgery being performed to correct aortic aneurysm.

Small aneurysms should be monitored for their rateof growth and large aneurysms require consideration for asurgical repair. The most common method of surgicalrepair is to cut out the bulging section of artery wall andsew a Dacron fiber material into its place in the vessel wall.\\nPrognosis\\nOnly 1-2% of people die from having surgical repair\\nof an aortic aneurysm.

The dissecting aorta usu-ally does not burst, but has an abnormal second channelwithin it.\\nDescription\\nA defect in the inner lining of the aorta allows an\\nopening or tear to develop. The aorta is the main artery ofthe body and is an area of high blood pressure. When adefect develops, blood pressure can force the tear to openand allow blood to pass through. Since the blood is underpressure, it eventually splits (dissecting) the middle layerof the blood vessel, creating a new channel for blood.The length of the channel grows over time and can resultin the closing off of connection points to other arteries.This can lead to heart attack , strokes, abdominal pain ,\\nand nerve damage. Blood may leak from the dissectionand collect in the chest an around the heart.A second mechanism leading to aortic dissection is\\nmedial hemorrhage. A medial hemorrhage occurs in themiddle layer of the blood vessel and spills through theinner lining of the aorta wall. This opening then allowsblood from the aorta to enter the vessel wall and begin adissection. Approximately 2,000 cases of aortic dissec-tion occur yearly in the United States.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAortic dissection is caused by a deterioration of the\\ninner lining of the aorta. There are a number of condi-tions that predispose a person to develop defects of theinner lining, including high blood pressure, Marfan’s dis-ease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , connective tissue dis-\\neases, and defects of heart development which begin dur-ing fetal development. A dissection can also occur acci-dentally following insertion of a catheter, trauma, orsurgery. The main symptom is sudden, intense pain. Thepain can be so intense as to immobilize the patient andcause him to fall to the ground. The pain is frequentlyfelt in both the chest and in the back, between the shoul-der blades. The extent of the pain is proportional to thelength of the dissection.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe pain experienced by the patient is the first symp-\\ntom of aortic dissection and is unique. The pain is usuallydescribed by the patient as “tearing, ripping, or stabbing.”This is in contrast to the pain associated with heartattacks. The patient frequently has a reduced or absentpulse in the extremities. A murmur may be heard if thedissection is close to the heart. An enlarged aorta will usu-ally appear in the chest x rays and ultrasound exams ofmost patients. The use of a blood dye in angiogramsand/or CT scans ( computed tomography scans ) will aid\\nin diagnosing and visualizing the dissection.\\nTreatment\\nBecause of the potentially fatal nature of aortic dis-\\nsection, patients are treated immediately. Drugs areadministered to reduce the blood pressure and heart rate.If the dissection is small, drug therapy alone may beused. In other cases, surgery is performed. In surgery,damaged sections of the aorta are removed and a synthet-ic graft is often used to reconstruct the damaged vessel.\\nPrognosis\\nDepending on the nature and extent of the dissection,\\ndeath can occur within a few hours of the start of a dis-\\nsection.

In aortic valveinsufficiency, the aortic valve becomes leaky, causingblood to flow backwards into the left ventricle.\\nDescription\\nAortic valve insufficiency occurs when this valve\\ncannot properly close after blood that is leaving theheart’s left ventricle enters the aorta. With each contrac-tion of the heart more and more blood flows back into theKEY TERMS\\nDissection —A cut or divide.\\nHemorrhage —A large discharge of blood, profuse\\nbleeding.left ventricle, causing the ventricle to become overfilled.\\nThis larger-than-normal amount of blood that collects inthe left ventricle puts pressure on the walls of the heart,causing the heart muscle to increase in thickness (hyper-trophy). If this thickening continues, the heart can be per-manently damaged.\\nAortic valve insufficiency is also know as aortic\\nvalve regurgitation because of the abnormal reversed flowof blood leaking through the poorly functioning valve.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe faulty working of the aortic valve can be caused\\nby a birth defect; by abnormal widening of the aorta (whichcan be caused by very high blood pressure and a variety ofother less common conditions); by various diseases thatcause large amounts of swelling (inflammation) in differentareas of the body, like rheumatic fever ; and, although\\nrarely, by the sexually transmitted disease, syphilis .\\nAbout 75% of people with aortic valve insufficiency\\nare men. Rheumatic (inflammatory) diseases have beenthe main cause of this condition in both men and women.\\nAortic valve insufficiency can remain unnoticed for\\n10 to 15 years.

A chest x ray , an electrocardio-\\ngram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heart beats), aswell as an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound wavesto create an image of the heart and its valves), can furtherevaluate or confirm the condition.\\nTreatment\\nAortic insufficiency is usually corrected by having\\nthe defective valve surgically replaced. However, such anoperation is done in severe cases. Before the conditionworsens, certain drugs can be used to help manage thiscondition.\\nDrugs that remove water from the body, drugs that\\nlower blood pressure, and drugs that help the heart beatmore effectively can each be used for this condition.Reducing the amount of salt in the diet also helps lowerthe amount of fluid the body holds and can help the heartto work more efficiently as well.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 328Aortic valve insufficiencyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 328'),\n",

The valve can bereplaced with a mechanical valve, a valve from a pig, or bymoving the patient’s other heart valve (pulmonary) into theposition of the aortic valve and then replacing the pul-monary valve with an mechanical one.

A February 2001 study publishedin the New England Journal of Medicine investigated\\nwhether Apgar scoring continues to be relevant.Researchers concluded that “The Apgar scoring systemremains as relevant for the prediction of neonatal sur-vival today as it was almost 50 years ago”.\\nDescription\\nThe five areas are scored as follows:\\n• Appearance, or color: 2 if the skin is pink all over; 1 for\\nacrocyanosis , where the trunk and head are pink, but\\nthe arms and legs are blue; and 0 if the whole body isblue. Newborns with naturally darker skin color willnot be pink. However, pallor is still noticeable, espe-cially in the soles and palms. Color is related to theneonate’s ability to oxygenate its body and extremities,and is dependent on heart rate and respirations. A per-fectly healthy newborn will often receive a score of 9because of some blueness in the hands and feet.\\n• Pulse (heart rate): 2 for a pulse of 100+ beats per minute\\n(bpm); 1 for a pulse below 100 bpm; 0 for no pulse.Heart rate is assessed by listening with a stethoscope tothe newborn’s heart and counting the number of beats.\\n• Grimace, or reflex irritability: 2 if the neonate coughs,\\nsneezes, or vigorously cries in response to a stimulusKEY TERMS\\nAcrocyanosis —A slight cyanosis, or blueness of\\nthe hands and feet of the neonate is considerednormal.

A crying newborn can adequately oxygenateits lungs. Respirations are best assessed by watchingthe rise and fall of the neonate’s abdomen, as infants arediaphragmatic breathers.\\nThe combined first letters in these five areas spell\\nApgar.\\nPreparation\\nNo preparation is needed to perform the test. How-\\never, while being born the neonate may receive nasal andoral suctioning to remove mucus and amniotic fluid. Thismay be done when the head of the newborn is safely out,while the mother rests before she continues to push.\\nAftercare\\nSince the test is primarily observational in nature, no\\naftercare is needed. However, the test may flag the needfor immediate intervention or prolonged observation.\\nNormal results\\nThe maximum possible score is 10, the minimum is\\nzero.

At this time, anesthesiology was a relativelynew field, having been left by the doctors mostly to theattention of nurses.

By 1937, shehad become the fiftieth physician to be certified as ananesthesiologist in the United States. The following yearshe was appointed director of anesthesiology at theColumbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, becoming thefirst woman to head a department at that institution.\\nAs the attending anesthesiologist who assisted in the\\ndelivery of thousands of babies during these years, Apgarrealized that infants had died from respiratory or circulato-ry complications that early treatment could have prevent-ed.

A person with aphasia may havedifficulty speaking, reading, writing, recognizing thenames of objects, or understanding what other peoplehave said. Aphasia is caused by a brain injury, as mayoccur during a traumatic accident or when the brain isdeprived of oxygen during a stroke . It may also be\\ncaused by a brain tumor , a disease such as Alzheimer’s,\\nor an infection, like encephalitis . Aphasia may be tem-\\nporary or permanent. Aphasia does not include speechimpediments caused by loss of muscle control.\\nDescription\\nTo understand and use language effectively, an indi-\\nvidual draws upon word memory—stored information onwhat certain words mean, how to put them together, andhow and when to use them properly. For a majority ofpeople, these and other language functions are located inthe left side (hemisphere) of the brain. Damage to thisside of the brain is most commonly linked to the devel-opment of aphasia. Interestingly, however, left-handedpeople appear to have language areas in both the left andright hemispheres of the brain and, as a result, maydevelop aphasia from damage to either side of the brain.\\nStroke is the most common cause of aphasia in the\\nUnited States. Approximately 500,000 individuals sufferstrokes each year, and 20% of these individuals developsome type of aphasia. Other causes of brain damageinclude head injuries, brain tumors, and infection. Abouthalf of the people who show signs of aphasia have whatis called temporary or transient aphasia and recover com-pletely within a few days. An estimated one millionAmericans suffer from some form of permanent aphasia.As yet, no connection between aphasia and age, gender,or race has been found.Aphasia is sometimes confused with other conditions\\nthat affect speech, such as dysarthria and apraxia. Thesecondition affect the muscles used in speaking rather thanlanguage function itself. Dysarthria is a speech distur-bance caused by lack of control over the muscles used inspeaking, perhaps due to nerve damage. Speech apraxia isa speech disturbance in which language comprehensionand muscle control are retained, but the memory of howto use the muscles to form words is not.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAphasia can develop after an individual sustains a\\nbrain injury from a stroke, head trauma, tumor, or infec-tion, such as herpes encephalitis. As a result of this injury,the pathways for language comprehension or productionare disrupted or destroyed. For most people, this meansdamage to the left hemisphere of the brain. (In 95 to 99%of right-handed people, language centers are in the lefthemisphere, and up to 70% of left-handed people alsohave left-hemisphere language dominance.) According tothe traditional classification scheme, each form of aphasiais caused by damage to a different part of the left hemi-sphere of the brain. This damage affects one or more of thebasic language functions: speech, naming (the ability toidentify an object, color, or other item with an appropriateword or term), repetition (the ability to repeat words,phrases, and sentences), hearing comprehension (the abili-ty to understand spoken language), reading (the ability tounderstand written words and their meaning), and writing(the ability to communicate and record events with text).\\nThe traditional classification scheme includes eight\\ntypes of aphasia:\\n• Broca’s aphasia, also called motor aphasia, results from\\ndamage to the front portion or frontal lobe of the lan-guage-dominant area of the brain. Individuals withBroca’s aphasia may be completely unable to use speech(mutism ) or may be able to use single-word statements\\nor even full sentences, though these sentences mayrequire a great deal of effort to construct. Small words,such as conjunctions (and, or, but) and articles (the, an,a), may be omitted, leading to a “telegraph” quality intheir speech. Hearing comprehension is usually notaffected, so they are able to understand other people’sspeech and conversation and can follow commands.Often, they may experience weakness on the right side oftheir bodies, which can make it difficult to write. Read-ing ability is impaired, and they may have difficulty find-ing the right word when speaking. Individuals withBroca’s aphasia may become frustrated and depressedbecause they are aware of their language difficulties.\\n• Wernicke’s aphasia is caused by damage to the side\\nportion or temporal lobe of the language-dominant area\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 333AphasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 333'),\n",

Individuals with Wernicke’s aphasia speak\\nin long, uninterrupted sentences; however, the wordsused are frequently unnecessary or even made-up. Theyhave a great deal of difficulty understanding other peo-ple’s speech, sometimes to the point of being unable tounderstand spoken language at all. Reading ability isdiminished, and although writing ability is retained,what is written may be abnormal. No physical symp-toms, such as the right-sided weakness seen withBroca’s aphasia, are typically observed. Also, in con-trast to Broca’s aphasia, individuals with Wernicke’saphasia are not aware of their language errors.\\n• Global aphasia is caused by widespread damage to the\\nlanguage areas of the left hemisphere. As a result, allbasic language functions are affected, but some areasmay be more affected than others. For example, an indi-vidual may have difficulty speaking but may be able towrite well. The individual may experience weaknessand loss of feeling on the right side of their body.\\n• Conduction aphasia, also called associative aphasia, is\\nrather uncommon. Individuals with conduction aphasiaare unable to repeat words, sentences, and phrases.Speech is fairly unbroken, although individuals may\\nfrequently correct themselves and words may beskipped or repeated. Although able to understand spo-ken language, it may also be difficult for the individualwith conduction aphasia to find the right word todescribe a person or object. The impact of this condi-tion on reading and writing ability varies. As with othertypes of aphasia, right-sided weakness or sensory lossmay be present.\\n• Anomic or nominal aphasia primarily influences an\\nindividual’s ability to find the right name for a personor object. As a result, an object may be described ratherthan named. Hearing comprehension, repetition, read-ing, and writing are not affected, other than by thisinability to find the right name. Speech is fluent, exceptfor pauses as the individual tries to recall the rightname. Physical symptoms are variable, and some indi-viduals have no symptoms of one-sided weakness orsensory loss.\\n• Transcortical aphasia is caused by damage to the lan-\\nguage areas of the left hemisphere outside the primarylanguage areas. There are three types of aphasia:transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory apha-sia, and mixed transcortical aphasia. All of the transcor-tical aphasias are distinguished from other types by theindividual’s ability to repeat words, phrases, or sen-tences. Other language functions may also be impairedto varying degrees, depending on the extent and partic-ular location of brain damage.\\nAs researchers continue to learn more about the\\nbrain’s structure and function, new types of aphasia arebeing recognized. One newly recognized type of aphasia,subcortical aphasia, mimics the symptoms of other tradi-tional types of aphasia but involves language disordersthat are not typical. This type of aphasia is associatedwith injuries to areas of the brain typically not identifiedwith language and language processing.\\nDiagnosis\\nFollowing brain injury, an initial bedside assessment is\\nmade to determine whether language function has beenaffected. If the individual experiences difficulty communi-cating, attempts are made to determine whether this diffi-culty arises from impaired language comprehension or animpaired ability to speak. A typical examination involveslistening to spontaneous speech and evaluating the individ-ual’s ability to recognize and name objects, comprehendwhat is heard, and repeat sample words and phrases. Theindividual may also be asked to read text aloud and explainwhat the passage means. In addition, writing ability is eval-uated by having the individual copy text, transcribe dictatedtext, and write something without prompting.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 334Aphasia Broca's areaWernicke's area\\nBroca’s aphasia results from damage to the frontal lobe of\\nthe language-dominant area of the brain.

The matureforms of these cells include red blood cells, which carryoxygen throughout the body; white blood cells, whichfight infection; and platelets, which are involved in clot-ting. In aplastic anemia, the basic structure of the marrowbecomes abnormal, and those cells responsible for gener-ating blood cells (hematopoietic cells) are greatlydecreased in number or absent. These hematopoieticcells are replaced by large quantities of fat.\\nYearly, aplastic anemia strikes about 5-10 people in\\nevery one million. Although aplastic anemia strikes bothmales and females of all ages, there are two age groupsthat have an increased risk. Both young adults (between15-30 years of age) and the elderly (over the age of 60)have higher rates of aplastic anemia than the generalpopulation. While the disorder occurs worldwide, youngadults in Asia have a higher disease rate than do popula-tions in North America and Europe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAplastic anemia falls into three basic categories,\\nbased on the origin of its cause: idiopathic, acquired, andhereditary.\\nIn about 60% of cases, aplastic anemia is considered\\nto be idiopathic, meaning that the cause of the disorder isunknown.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 336Aplastic anemiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 336'),\n",

The patient is likely to appear pale. If theanemia progresses, decreased oxygen circulating in theblood may lead to an increase in heart rate and the sud-den appearance of a new heart murmur.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe blood count in aplastic anemia will reveal low\\nnumbers of all formed blood cells. Red blood cells willappear normal in size and coloration, but greatlydecreased in number. Cells called reticulocytes (veryyoung red blood cells, which are usually produced ingreat numbers by the bone marrow in order to compen-sate for a severe anemia) will be very low in number.Platelets and white blood cells will also be decreased innumber, though normal in structure.\\nA sample of the patient’s bone marrow will need to\\nbe removed by needle (usually from the hip bone) andexamined under a microscope. If aplastic anemia is pre-sent, this examination will reveal very few or nohematopoietic cells, and replacement with fat.Treatment\\nThe first step in the treatment of aplastic anemia\\ninvolves discontinuing exposure to any substance thatmay be causing the disorder. Although it would seem thatblood transfusions would be helpful in this disease, infact, they only serve as a temporary help, and may com-plicate future attempts at bone marrow transplantation .\\nThe most successful treatment for aplastic anemia is\\nbone marrow transplantation. To do this, a marrow donor(often a sibling) must be identified. There are a number oftissue markers which must be examined to determinewhether a bone marrow donation is likely to be compatiblewith the patient’s immune system. Compatibility is neces-sary to avoid complications, including the destruction ofthe donor marrow by the patient’s own immune system.\\nPatients who cannot undergo bone marrow trans-\\nplant can be treated with a number of agents, includingantithymocyte globulin (ATG), cyclophosphamide,steroids, and cyclosporine. These agents all have thepotential to cause a number of troublesome side-effects.Furthermore, not all patients respond fully to theseagents. Still, even among those patients who do have agood response, many later suffer a relapse (return) ofaplastic anemia.\\nPrognosis\\nAplastic anemia is a life-threatening illness. Without\\ntreatment, it will almost surely progress to death . Sur-\\nvival depends on how severe the disease is at diagnosis,which type of treatment a patient is eligible for, and whatkind of response their body has to that treatment. Theworst-prognosis type of aplastic anemia is one associatedwith very low numbers of a particular type of whiteblood cell. These patients have a high chance of dyingfrom overwhelming bacterial infections. In fact, 80% ofall patients treated with blood transfusions alone diewithin 18 months to two years. Patients who undergobone marrow transplantation have a 60-90% chance ofbeing cured of the disease.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCastro-Malaspina, Hugo, and Richard J.

Occasionally a spinal anesthetic may be used.\\nAfter the patient is anesthetized, the general surgeon\\ncan remove the appendix either by using the traditionalopen procedure (in which a 2-3 [5-7.6 cm] in incision ismade in the abdomen) or via laparoscopy (in which four\\n1 in [2.5 cm] incisions are made in the abdomen).\\nTraditional open appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon uses the open approach, he makes\\nan incision in the lower right section of the abdomen. Mostincisions are less than 3 in (7.6 cm) in length. The surgeonthen identifies all of the organs in the abdomen and exam-ines them for other disease or abnormalities. The appendixis located and brought up into the wounds . The surgeon\\nseparates the appendix from all the surrounding tissue andits attachment to the cecum and then removes it. The sitewhere the appendix was previously attached, the cecum, isclosed and returned to the abdomen. The muscle layersand then the skin are sewn together.\\nLaproscopic appendectomy\\nWhen the surgeon conducts a laproscopic appendec-\\ntomy, four incisions, each about 1 in (2.5 cm) in length,are made. One incision is near the umbilicus, or navel,and one is between the umbilicus and the pubis. Twoother incisions are smaller and are in the right side of thelower abdomen. The surgeon then passes a camera andspecial instruments through these incisions. With the aidof this equipment, the surgeon visually examines theabdominal organs and identifies the appendix. Similarly,the appendix is freed from all of its attachments andremoved. The place where the appendix was formerlyattached, the cecum, is stitched. The appendix isremoved through one of the incisions. The instrumentsare removed and then all of the incisions are closed.\\nStudies and opinions about the relative advantages\\nand disadvantages of each method are divided.

Since LA alsorequires specialized equipment, the fees for its use alsoincreases the hospital charges. Patients with either opera-tion have similar pain medication needs, begin eatingdiets at comparable times, and stay in the hospital equiv-\\nalent amounts of time.

Hospital charges include fees for operating\\nand recovery room use, diagnostic and laboratory testing,as well as the normal hospital room charges. Surgicalfees vary from region to region and range between $250-$750.

Patients are asked to walk and resume theirnormal physical activities as soon as possible. If TA wasdone, work and physical education classes may be restrict-ed for a full three weeks after the operation. If a LA wasdone, most patients are able to return to work and strenuousactivity within one to three weeks after the operation.\\nRisks\\nCertain risks are present when any operation requires\\na general anesthetic and the abdominal cavity is opened.Pneumonia and collapse of the small airways ( atelecta-\\nsis) often occurs. Patients who smoke are at a greater risk\\nfor developing these complications. Thrombophlebitis ,\\nor inflammation of the veins, is rare but can occur if thepatient requires prolonged bed rest. Bleeding can occurbut rarely is a blood transfusion required. Adhesions\\n(abnormal connections to abdominal organs by thinfibrous tissue) is a known complication of any abdominalprocedure such as appendectomy. These adhesions canlead to intestinal obstruction which prevents the normalflow of intestinal contents. Hernia is a complication of\\nany incision, However, they are rarely seen after appen-dectomy because the abdominal wall is very strong in thearea of the standard appendectomy incision.\\nThe overall complication rate of appendectomy\\ndepends upon the status of the appendix at the time it isremoved. If the appendix has not ruptured the complicationrate is only about 3%. However, if the appendix has rup-tured the complication rate rises to almost 59%. Woundinfections do occur and are more common if the appendici-tis was severe, far advanced, or ruptured. An abscess may\\nform in the abdomen as a complication of appendicitis.\\nOccasionally, an appendix will rupture prior to its\\nremoval, spilling its contents into the abdominal cavity.Peritonitis or a generalized infection in the abdomen\\nwill occur. Treatment of peritonitis as a result of a rup-tured appendix includes removal of what remains of theappendix, insertion of drains (rubber tubes that promotethe flow of infection inside the abdomen to outside of thebody), and antibiotics. Fistula formation (an abnormalconnection between the cecum and the skin) rarelyoccurs. It is only seen if the appendix has a broad attach-ment to the cecum and the appendicitis is far advancedcausing destruction of the cecum itself.\\nNormal results\\nMost patients feel better immediately after an opera-\\ntion for appendicitis.

The appendix has noknown function in the body, but it can become diseased.Appendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is leftuntreated the appendix may rupture and cause a poten-tially fatal infection.\\nDescription\\nAppendicitis is the most common abdominal emer-\\ngency found in children and young adults. One person in15 develops appendicitis in his or her lifetime. The inci-dence is highest among males aged 10-14, and amongfemales aged 15-19. More males than females developappendicitis between puberty and age 25. It is rare in the\\nelderly and in children under the age of two.\\nThe hallmark symptom of appendicitis is increasing-\\nly severe abdominal pain . Since many different condi-\\ntions can cause abdominal pain, an accurate diagnosis ofappendicitis can be difficult. A timely diagnosis is impor-tant, however, because a delay can result in perforation,or rupture, of the appendix. When this happens, theinfected contents of the appendix spill into the abdomen,potentially causing a serious infection of the abdomencalled peritonitis .\\nOther conditions can have similar symptoms, espe-\\ncially in women. These include pelvic inflammatorydisease , ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured ovarian\\ncysts , tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis . Various\\nforms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation mayalso mimic appendicitis.\\nThe treatment for acute (sudden, severe) appendici-\\ntis is an appendectomy , surgery to remove the appendix.\\nBecause of the potential for a life-threatening rupturedappendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis areoften taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of appendicitis are not well understood,\\nbut it is believed to occur as a result of one or more ofthese factors: an obstruction within the appendix, thedevelopment of an ulceration (an abnormal change in tis-sue accompanied by the death of cells) within the appen-\\ndix, and the invasion of bacteria.\\nUnder these conditions, bacteria may multiply with-\\nin the appendix. The appendix may become swollen andfilled with pus (a fluid formed in infected tissue, consist-ing of while blood cells and cellular debris), and mayeventually rupture. Signs of rupture include the presenceof symptoms for more than 24 hours, a fever , a high\\nwhite blood cell count, and a fast heart rate.

The pain, whichmay be severe or only achy and uncomfortable, eventual-ly moves into the right lower corner of the abdomen.There, it becomes more steady and more severe, andoften increases with movement, coughing, and so forth.The abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to thetouch. Increasing rigidity and tenderness indicates anincreased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis.\\nLoss of appetite is very common. Nausea and vom-\\niting may occur in about half of the cases and occasion-\\nally there may be constipation or diarrhea . The temper-\\nature may be normal or slightly elevated. The presence ofa fever may indicate that the appendix has ruptured.\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful examination is the best way to diagnose\\nappendicitis. It is often difficult even for experiencedphysicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitisfrom those of other abdominal disorders. Therefore, veryspecific questioning and a thorough physical examina-\\ntion are crucial. The physician should ask questions,\\nsuch as where the pain is centered, whether the pain hasshifted, and where the pain began. The physician shouldpress on the abdomen to judge the location of the painand the degree of tenderness.\\nThe typical sequence of symptoms is present in about\\n50% of cases. In the other half of cases, less typical pat-terns may be seen, especially in pregnant women, olderpatients, and infants. In pregnant women, appendicitis iseasily masked by the frequent occurrence of mild abdom-inal pain and nausea from other causes. Elderly patientsmay feel less pain and tenderness than most patients,thereby delaying diagnosis and treatment, and leading torupture in 30% of cases. Infants and young children oftenhave diarrhea, vomiting, and fever in addition to pain.\\nWhile laboratory tests cannot establish the diagno-\\nsis, an increased white cell count may point to appendici-tis. Urinalysis may help to rule out a urinary tract infec-\\ntion that can mimic appendicitis.\\nPatients whose symptoms and physical examination\\nare compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usual-ly taken immediately to surgery, where a laparotomy(surgical exploration of the abdomen) is done to confirmthe diagnosis. In cases with a questionable diagnosis,other tests, such as a computed tomography scan (CT)may be performed to avoid unnecessary surgery. Anultrasound examination of the abdomen may help toidentify an inflamed appendix or other condition thatwould explain the symptoms. Abdominal x-rays are not\\nof much value except when the appendix has ruptured.\\nOften, the diagnosis is not certain until an operation is\\ndone. To avoid a ruptured appendix, surgery may be recom-mended without delay if the symptoms point clearly toappendicitis. If the symptoms are not clear, surgery may bepostponed until they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis.\\nWhen appendicitis is strongly suspected in a woman\\nof child-bearing age, a diagnostic laparoscopy (an\\nexamination of the interior of the abdomen) is sometimesrecommended before the appendectomy in order to besure that a gynecological problem, such as a rupturedovarian cyst, is not causing the pain. In this procedure, alighted viewing tube is inserted into the abdomenthrough a small incision around the navel.\\nA normal appendix is discovered in about 10-20% of\\npatients who undergo laparotomy, because of suspectedappendicitis. Sometimes the surgeon will remove a nor-mal appendix as a safeguard against appendicitis in thefuture. During the surgery, another specific cause for thepain and symptoms of appendicitis is found for about30% of these patients.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of appendicitis is an immediate\\nappendectomy. This may be done by opening theabdomen in the standard open appendectomy technique,or through laparoscopy. In laparoscopy, a smaller inci-sion is made through the navel. Both methods can suc-cessfully accomplish the removal of the appendix. It isnot certain that laparoscopy holds any advantage overopen appendectomy. When the appendix has ruptured,patients undergoing a laparoscopic appendectomy mayhave to be switched to the open appendectomy procedurefor the successful management of the rupture. If a rup-tured appendix is left untreated, the condition is fatal.\\nPrognosis\\nAppendicitis is usually treated successfully by appen-\\ndectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient shouldrecover without further problems. The mortality rate incases without complications is less than 0.1%. When anappendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has developed,the likelihood is higher for complications, with slowerrecovery, or death from disease. There are higher rates ofperforation and mortality among children and the elderly.\\nPrevention\\nAppendicitis is probably not preventable, although\\nthere is some indication that a diet high in green vegeta-bles and tomatoes may help prevent appendicitis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 342AppendicitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 342'),\n",

Itincorporates a system of manual muscle testing andtherapy. AK is based on the theory that an organ dys-function is accompanied by a specific muscle weakness.Diseases are diagnosed through muscle-testing proce-dures and then treated. AK is not the same as kinesiolo-gy, or biomechanics, which is the scientific study ofmovement.KEY TERMS\\nAppendectomy (or appendicectomy) —Surgical\\nremoval of the appendix.\\nAppendix —The worm-shaped pouch attached to\\nthe cecum, the beginning of the large intestine.\\nLaparotomy —Surgical incision into the loin,\\nbetween the ribs and the pelvis, which offers sur-geons a view inside the abdominal cavity.\\nPeritonitis —Inflammation of the peritoneum,\\nmembranes lining the abdominal pelvic wall.Purpose\\nAK is not designed for crisis medicine. For example,\\nan AK practitioner cannot cure cancer , arthritis, dia-\\nbetes, heart disease, or infections. This therapy isdesigned to be a part of a holistic approach to preventivemedicine. The goals of AK are to (1) restore normalnerve function, (2) achieve normal endocrine, immune,digestive, and other internal organ functions, (3) inter-vene early in degenerative processes to prevent or delaypathological conditions, and to (4) restore postural bal-ance, correct gait (walking) impairment, and improverange of motion.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nAK is based on principles of functional neurology,\\nanatomy, physiology, biomechanics, and biochemistry aswell as principles from Chinese medicine, acupuncture ,\\nand massage. It was developed from traditional kinesiolo-gy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor fromDetroit, Michigan. He observed that each large musclerelates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle may meanthat there is a problem in the associated organ. Goodheartfound that by treating the muscle and making it strongagain, he was able to improve the function of the organ aswell. For example, if a particular nutritional supplementwas given to a patient, and the muscle tested strong, it wasthe correct supplement for the patient. If the muscleremained weak, it was not. Other methods of treatmentcan be evaluated in a similar manner. Goodheart alsofound that painful nodules (small bumps) may be associat-ed with a weak muscle. By deeply massaging the muscle,he was able to improve its strength. Goodheart’s findingsin 1964 led to the origin and insertion treatment, the firstmethod developed in AK. Other diagnostic and therapeuticprocedures were developed for various reflexes describedby other chiropractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporat-ed acupuncture meridian therapy into AK after reading thewritings of Felix Mann, M.D.\\nGoodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool\\nthat incorporates feedback from the body. He said that“applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the bodylanguage never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscleswere indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weaknesshas been ascertained, the problem may be solved in avariety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problemcorrectly, he believed, making the proper and adequatediagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory bothto the doctor and to the patient.\\nAccording to AK, each muscle in the body relates to\\na specific meridian or energy pathway (acupuncture\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 343Applied kinesiologyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 343'),\n",

These meridians also relate to organs\\nor glands, allowing the muscles to provide informationabout organ or gland function and energy. The five areasof diagnosis and therapy for the applied kinesiologist are(1) the nervous system, (2) the lymphatic system, (3) thevascular (blood vessel) system, (4) the cerebrospinal sys-tem, and (5) the meridian system.\\nThe first part of AK is muscle testing, which is used\\nto help diagnose what part of the body is functioningabnormally. Muscle testing involves putting the bodyinto a position that requires a certain muscle to remaincontracted, and then applying pressure against the mus-cle. The testing does not measure strength but is meant toreveal stresses and imbalances in the body through thetension in the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of acontrolling system (like the nervous system) to adapt themuscle to meet the changing pressure of the examiner’stest. AK practitioners also examine structural factorssuch as posture, gait, and range of motion. Some chiro-GEORGE GOODHEART (1918– )\\nDr. George Goodheart was born in Detroit, Michi-\\ngan, in 1918 and became a second-generation doctor ofchiropractic. He graduated from the National College ofChiropractic in 1939 and is recognized as the founderand developer of Applied Kinesiology. After he joinedthe U.S. Air Force as an aviation cadet in World War II,he received a promotion to major at the age of 22. Hewas the youngest ever to attain that rank. He served inactive duty from 1941-1946 and continued as a mem-ber of the Air Force Reserve until the mid-1950s.\\nDr. Goodheart held numerous positions of distinc-\\ntion during his career, including director of the NationalChiropractic Mutual Insurance Company and directorfor the International College of Applied Kinesiology-U.S.A. He also lectured and taught throughout the Unit-ed States, Japan, Europe, and Australia; and he was theofficial doctor of chiropractic for the Lake Placed WinterOlympic Games in 1980. He contributes to a variety oftrade publications on a regular basis.\\nIn 1998 Dr. Goodheart received a Lifetime\\nAchievement Award from the International College ofKinesiology. Earlier, in 1987 he was honored with theLeonardo da Vinci Award from the Institute for theAchievement of Human Potential, and he was cited forhis research by Logan and Palmer Colleges of Chiro-practic. He represented the State of Michigan as a dele-gate to the American Chiropractic Association and wasa fellow at the International College of Chiropractic. Heresides with his wife, JoAnn in Grosse Pointe Woods,Michigan, where he enjoys skiing and tennis.practors use AK to help them evaluate the success of\\nspinal adjustment. A leg muscle is tested for strength orweakness to determine whether the adjustments made areappropriate.\\nAccording to AK, common internal causes of mus-\\ncle weakness include:\\n• dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interference\\nbetween spine and muscles)\\n• impairment of lymphatic drainage\\n• reduction of blood supply• abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerve-to-\\nmuscle relationships\\n• blockage of an acupuncture meridian\\n• imbalance of chemicals\\n• dysfunction of organs or glands• excesses or deficiencies in nutrition\\nPhysiological reactions to chemicals, including\\nthose associated with nutrition and allergies , may also be\\nevaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing chemi-cal compounds is to place the substance on the patient’stongue so that he tastes the material, and the normalchemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some cases, thesubstances are inhaled through the nose. The AK practi-tioner then tests the associated muscle-organ pattern todetermine where or if there is a strength or weakness.The patient does not need to swallow the substance for achange in strength or weakness to be identified. David S.Walther, a diplomate of the International College ofApplied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is possiblethat the central nervous system, recognizing the com-pound being ingested, relays information to the organsand glands preparing for use of the compound. If thecompound is recognized as beneficial, the energy patternis immediately enhanced, influencing not only the organor gland, but also the associated muscle.”\\nAK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for a\\nvariety of conditions.\\nBone health\\n• neck/low back pain and sciatica\\n• whiplash• frozen shoulder\\nJoint health\\n• carpal tunnel syndrome• arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis)• sports injuries\\nMuscle health\\n• tennis elbow\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 344Applied kinesiologyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 344'),\n",

Most practi-tioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, medicaldoctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical thera-pists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists, andnurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2% of4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States whoresponded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro-practic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in theirpractice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31%of chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% inNew Zealand use AK.\\nMost practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach\\nand evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec-tive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal-ing from a structural basis, medical doctors generallyfrom a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo-gists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol-ogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, andin some cases, include a spiritual dimension.\\nThe use of AK is often included in insurance cover-\\nage if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost ofthe AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro-practic practices.\\nPrecautions\\nAK should only by used by trained professionals\\nwith the necessary expertise to perform specific andaccurate tests. The AK examination should be combinedwith a standard physical diagnosis, which often includeslaboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, andother special tests. An AK examination should enhance astandard diagnosis, not replace it. The total diagnosticwork-up should be used to determine the final diagnosis.\\nThe use of manual muscle testing to evaluate nutri-\\ntion is particularly a problem if it is done by a lay nutri-tion sales person as a tool to sell his/her product. The per-son should have the educational background to evaluatenutritional needs as well as have a high level of knowl-edge in the use of proper muscle testing techniques.\\nSide effects\\nIf AK is performed by a trained practitioner with the\\nappropriate educational background, side effects fromthe muscle-testing procedures should be minimal.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAK is a tool that is used by many health care pro-\\nfessionals, and especially by chiropractors. A literaturereview published in 1999 by researchers from the\\nSchool of Medicine at the University of North Carolinaat Chapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conserva-tive Therapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that,although AK appears to be a promising methodology,there is a lack of research results relevant to clinicalpractice and outcomes of AK care. They found thislack of results surprising, since cost, satisfaction, uti-lization, and changes in symptoms are the importantresults of clinical practice. In addition, they determinedthat some studies that were supposed to be an evalua-tion of AK procedures did not actually use clinicalpractices and principles of AK. However, from studiesadhering to AK principles and employing standardizedtraining by well-trained practitioners, they did statethere was some evidence that AK is an objectively veri-fiable phenomenon. They suggested that “future stud-ies of AK should focus on outcomes of care, includingsymptoms, function, costs, and safety. Only well-designed studies that account for the individual natureof AK diagnosis and treatment and preserve the properclinical context of AK treatment will be informative.Understanding the individual components of theprocess of AK treatment remains important. Studiesaddressing validation of isolated AK procedures needto meet the methodological challenges of studyingappropriate subjects that reflects the current recog-nized practice and understanding of AK. Further evalu-ation of the basic physiologic phenomena involved andcorrelation of AK manual muscle test results will alsoadvance understanding of this diagnostic and therapeu-tic system.”\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHoldway, Anne.

The term arbovirus stands for Arthro-\\npod-borne virus because these viruses are passed to\\nhumans by members of the phylum Arthropoda (whichincludes insects and spiders).\\nDescription\\nOf the huge number of arboviruses known to exist,\\nabout 80 types are responsible for human disease. Inaddition to the virus, there are usually two other types ofliving creatures involved in the cycle leading to humandisease. When large quantities of virus are present in anarthropod (often a tick or mosquito), the viruses arepassed to a bird or small mammal when the arthropodattempts to feed on the blood of that creature. The virusthrives within the new host, sometimes causing illness,sometimes not. More ticks or mosquitoes are infectedwith the virus when they feed on the host’s blood. Even-tually, a tick or mosquito bites a human, and the virus ispassed along. Just a few types of arboviruses cycle onlybetween arthropods and humans, with no intermediatestop in a bird or small mammal.\\nBecause the arboviruses require an arthropod to pass\\nthem along to humans, the most common times of yearfor these illnesses include summer and fall, when mos-quitoes and ticks are most prevalent. Damp environmentsfavor large populations of mosquitoes, and thus alsoincrease the risk of arbovirus infections.\\nThe major causes of arbovirus encephalitis include\\nthe members of the viral families alphavirus (causingEastern equine encephalitis, Western equine encephalitis,and Venezuelan equine encephalitis), flavivirus (respon-sible for St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis ,\\nTick-borne encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis,Russian spring-summer encephalitis, and Powassan), andbunyavirus (causing California encephalitis).\\nIn the United States, the most important types of\\narbovirus encephalitis include Western equine encephali-tis (WEE), Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), St. Louisencephalitis, and California encephalitis. WEE strikesyoung infants in particular, with a 5% chance of death\\nfrom the illness. Of those who survive, about 60% sufferpermanent brain damage. EEE strikes infants and chil-dren, with a 20% chance of death, and a high rate of per-manent brain damage among survivors. St. Louisencephalitis tends to strike adults older than 40 years ofage, and older patients tend to have higher rates of deathand long-term disability from the infection. Californiavirus primarily strikes 5-18 year olds, with a lowerdegree of permanent brain damage.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEncephalitis occurs because specific arboviruses\\nhave biochemical characteristics which cause them to beparticularly attracted to the cells of the brain and thenerves. The virus causes cell death and inflammation,with fever and swelling within the brain and nerves. The\\nmembranous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (themeninges) may also become inflamed, a condition calledmeningitis . The brain is swollen, and patches of bleed-\\ning occur throughout the brain and spinal cord.\\nPatients with encephalitis suffer from headaches,\\nfever, nausea and vomiting , stiff neck, and sleepiness.\\nAs the disease progresses, more severe symptoms devel-op, including tremors , confusion, seizures, coma , and\\nparalysis . Loss of function occurs when specific nerve\\nareas are damaged and/or killed.\\nDiagnosis\\nEarly in the disease, laboratory testing of blood may\\nreveal the presence of the arbovirus. The usual techniqueused to verify the presence of arbovirus involves injectingthe patient’s blood into the brain of a newborn mouse,then waiting to see if the mouse develops encephalitis.Diagnosis is usually based on the patient’s symptoms,history of tick or mosquito bites, and knowledge that thepatient has been in an area known to harbor the arbovirus.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is mostly supportive, meaning it is direct-\\ned at improving the symptoms, but does not shorten thecourse of the illness. The main concerns of treatmentinvolve lowering fever, treating pain , avoiding dehydra-\\ntion or other chemical imbalances, and decreasing\\nswelling in the brain with steroids.\\nPrognosis\\nPrognosis depends on the particular type of\\narbovirus causing disease, and on the age and priorhealth status of the patient. Death rates range all the wayup to 20% for arbovirus encephalitis, and the rates oflifelong effects due to brain damage reach 60% for sometypes of arboviruses.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention involves avoiding contact with arthro-\\npods which carry these viruses. This means wearing\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 347Arbovirus encephalitisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 347'),\n",

Essential oils areused to treat a wide range of symptoms and conditions,including, but not limited to, gastrointestinal discomfort,skin conditions, menstrual pain and irregularities, stress-\\nrelated conditions, mood disorders , circulatory prob-\\nlems, respiratory infections, and wounds .\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nAromatic plants have been employed for their heal-\\ning, preservative, and pleasurable qualities throughoutrecorded history in both the East and West. As early as1500 \\nB.C. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils,\\nincense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals fortheir religious ceremonies.\\nThere is evidence that the Chinese may have recog-\\nnized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies muchearlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, ShenNung’s Pen Ts’ao (c. 2700-3000 \\nB.C.) catalogs over 200\\nbotanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indianmedicine that dates back over 2,500 years, also used aro-matic herbs for treatment.\\nThe Romans were well-known for their use of fra-\\ngrances. They bathed with botanicals and integratedthem into their state and religious rituals. So did theGreeks, with a growing awareness of the medicinal prop-erties of herbs, as well. Greek physician and surgeonPedanios Dioscorides, whose renown herbal text De\\nMateria Medica (60 \\nA.D.) was the standard textbook for\\nWestern medicine for 1,500 years, wrote extensively onthe medicinal value of botanical aromatics. The Medica\\ncontained detailed information on over 500 plants and4,740 separate medicinal uses for them, including anentire section on aromatics.\\nWritten records of herbal distillation are found as early\\nas the first century \\nA.D., and around 1000 A.D., the noted\\nArab physician and naturalist Avicenna described the distil-lation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medicinal prop-erties of essential oils in his writings. However, it wasn’tuntil 1937, when French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossépublished Aromatherapie: Les Huiles essentielles, hor-\\nmones végé tales , that aromatherapie, or aromatherapy, was\\nintroduced in Europe as a medical discipline. Gattefossé,who was employed by a French perfumeur, discovered thehealing properties of lavender oil quite by accident whenhe suffered a severe burn while working and used the clos-est available liquid, lavender oil, to soak it in.\\nIn the late 20th century, French physician Jean Valnet\\nused botanical aromatics as a front line treatment forwounded soldiers in World War II. He wrote about his use\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 348AromatherapyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 348'),\n",

Later, French biochemist Mauguerite Maurypopularized the cosmetic benefits of essential oils, and in1977 Robert Tisserand wrote the first English languagebook on the subject, The Art of Aromatherapy , which intro-\\nduced massage as an adjunct treatment to aromatherapy andsparked its popularity in the United Kingdom.\\nIn aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully selected\\nfor their medicinal properties. As essential oils areabsorbed into the bloodstream through application to theskin or inhalation, their active components trigger certainpharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief).\\nIn addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy has\\nstrong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil, orthe speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought tobe linked to the specific psychological effect of an oil. Asa rule of thumb, oils that evaporate quickly are consid-ered emotionally uplifting, while slowly-evaporating oilsare thought to have a calming effect.\\nEssential oils commonly used in aromatherapy treat-\\nment include:\\n• Roman chamomile ( Chamaemelum nobilis ). An anti-\\ninflammatory and analgesic. Useful in treating otitis\\nmedia (earache), skin conditions, menstrual pains, and\\ndepression.\\n• Clary sage ( Salvia sclarea ). This natural astringent is\\nnot only used to treat oily hair and skin, but is also saidto be useful in regulating the menstrual cycle, improv-ing mood, and controlling high blood pressure. Clarysage should not be used by pregnant women.\\n• Lavender ( Lavandula officinalis ). A popular aromather-\\napy oil which mixes well with most essential oils,lavender has a wide range of medicinal and cosmeticapplications, including treatment of insect bites, burns ,\\nrespiratory infections, intestinal discomfort, nausea,migraine, insomnia , depression, and stress .\\n• Myrtle ( Myrtus communis ). Myrtle is a fungicide, dis-\\ninfectant, and antibacterial. It is often used in steamaromatherapy treatments to alleviate the symptoms ofwhooping cough ,bronchitis , and other respiratory\\ninfections.\\n• Neroli (bitter orange), ( Citrus aurantium ). Citrus oil\\nextracted from bitter orange flower and peel and used totreat sore throat , insomnia, and stress and anxiety-\\nrelated conditions.\\n• Sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ). An essential oil used to\\ntreat stomach complaints and known for its reportedability to lift the mood while relieving stress.• Peppermint ( Mentha piperita ). Relaxes and soothes the\\nstomach muscles and gastrointestinal tract. Pepper-mint’s actions as an anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, andantimicrobial also make it an effective skin treatment,and useful in fighting cold and flu symptoms.\\n• Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis ). Stimulating essen-\\ntial oil used to treat muscular and rheumatic com-plaints, as well as low blood pressure, gastrointestinalproblems, and headaches.\\n• Tea tree ( Melaleuca alternifolia ).

A small amount of\\nessential oil can also be added to a bowl of hot water andused as a steam treatment. This technique is recommend-ed when aromatherapy is used to treat respiratory and/orskin conditions. Aromatherapy steam devices are alsoavailable commercially. A warm bath containing essen-tial oils can have the same effect as steam aromatherapy,with the added benefit of promoting relaxation. Whenused in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather than hotto slow the evaporation of the oil.\\nEssential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulb\\nrings can be used to disperse essential oils over a largearea. These devices can be particularly effective in aro-matherapy that uses essential oils to promote a healthierhome environment. For example, eucalyptus and tea treeoil are known for their antiseptic qualities and are fre-quently used to disinfect sickrooms, and citronella andgeranium can be useful in repelling insects.\\nDirect application\\nBecause of their potency, essential oils are diluted in\\na carrier oil or lotion before being applied to the skin toprevent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil can be avegetable or olive based one, such as wheat germ or avo-cado. Light oils, such as safflower, sweet almond, grape-seed, hazelnut, apricot seed, or peach kernel, may beabsorbed more easily by the skin. Standard dilutions ofessential oils in carrier oils range from 2–10%. However,some oils can be used at higher concentrations, and oth-ers should be diluted further for safe and effective use.The type of carrier oil used and the therapeutic use of theapplication may also influence how the essential oil ismixed. Individuals should seek guidance from a health-care professional and/or aromatherapist when diluting\\nessential oils.\\nMassage is a common therapeutic technique used in\\nconjunction with aromatherapy to both relax the bodyand thoroughly administer the essential oil treatment.Essential oils can also be used in hot or cold compressesand soaks to treat muscle aches and pains (e.g., lavenderand ginger). As a sore throat remedy, antiseptic andsoothing essential oils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can bethoroughly mixed with water and used as a gargle ormouthwash.\\nInternal use\\nSome essential oils can be administered internally in\\ntincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat certainsymptoms or conditions; however, this treatment shouldnever be self-administered. Essential oils should only betaken internally under the supervision of a qualifiedhealthcare professional.\\nAs non-prescription botanical preparations, the\\nessential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not paidfor by health insurance. The self-administered nature ofthe therapy controls costs to some degree.

The heartbeat can be too slow, too fast,have extra beats, skip a beat, or otherwise beat irregularly.\\nDescription\\nArrhythmias are deviations from the normal cadence\\nof the heartbeat, which cause the heart to pump improp-erly. The normal heartbeat starts in the right atrium,where the heart’s natural pacemaker (the sinus node)sends an electrical signal to the center of the heart to theatrioventricular node. The atrioventricular node thensends signals into the main pumping chamber to makethe ventricle contract. Arrhythmias occur when the heart-beat starts in a part of the heart other than the sinus node,an abnormal rate or rhythm develops in the sinus node, ora heart conduction “block” prevents the electrical signalfrom traveling down the normal pathway.\\nMore than four million Americans have arrhythmias,\\nmost of which are harmless. Middle-aged adults common-ly experience arrhythmias. As people age, the probabilityof experiencing an arrhythmia increases. Arrhythmiasoften occur in people who do not have heart disease. Inpeople with heart disease, it is usually the heart diseasewhich is dangerous, not the arrhythmia. Arrhythmias oftenoccur during and after heart attacks. Some types ofarrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia , are serious\\nand even life threatening. In the United States, arrhythmiasare the primary cause of sudden cardiac death , account-\\ning for more than 350,000 deaths each year.\\nSlow heart rates (less than 60 beats per minute) are\\ncalled bradycardias, while fast heart rates (more than 100beats per minute) are called tachycardias. Bradycardiacan result in poor circulation of blood, and, hence, a lackof oxygen throughout the body, especially the brain.Tachycardias also can compromise the heart’s ability topump effectively because the ventricles do not haveenough time to completely fill.\\nArrhythmias are characterized by their site of origin:\\nthe atria or the ventricles. Supraventricular arrhythmiasoccur in the upper areas of the heart and are less seriousthan ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular fibrillation is\\nthe most serious arrhythmia and is fatal unless medicalhelp is immediate.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn many cases, the cause of an arrhythmia is\\nunknown.

Sometimes arrhythmias can be identified bylistening to the patient’s heart through a stethoscope, but,since arrhythmias are not always present, they may notoccur during the physical exam.\\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) shows the heart’s\\nactivity and may reveal a lack of oxygen from poor circu-lation ( ischemia ). Electrodes covered with conducting\\njelly are placed on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs.They send impulses of the heart’s activity through anelectrical activity monitor (oscilloscope) to a recorderthat traces them on paper. The test takes about 10 min-utes and is performed in a physician’s office. Anothertype of ECG, commonly known as the exercisestress\\ntest, measures how the heart and blood vessels respond\\nto exertion while the patient is exercising on a treadmillor a stationary bike. This test is performed in a physi-cian’s office or an exercise laboratory and takes 15-30minutes. Other types of ECGs include 24-hour ECGmonitoring and transtelephonic monitoring. In 24-hourECG (Holter) monitoring, the patient wears a small,portable tape recorder connected to disks on his/her chestthat record the heart’s rhythm during daily activities.Transtelephonic monitoring can identify arrhythmias thatoccur infrequently. Similar to Holter monitoring ,\\ntranstelephonic monitoring can continue for days orweeks, and it enables patients to send the ECG via tele-phone to a monitoring station when an arrhythmia is felt,or the patient can store the information in the recorderand transmit it later.\\nElectrophysiologic studies are invasive procedures\\nperformed in a hospital to identify the origin of seriousarrhythmias and responses to various treatments. Theyinvolve cardiac catheterization , in which catheters\\ntipped with electrodes are passed from a vein in the armor leg through the blood vessels into the heart. The elec-trodes record impulses in the heart, highlighting wherethe arrhythmia starts. During the procedure, physicianscan test the effects of various drugs by provoking anarrhythmia through the electrodes and trying differentdrugs. The procedure takes one to three hours, duringwhich the patient is awake but mildly sedated. Localanesthetic is injected at the catheter insertion sites.Treatment\\nMany arrhythmias do not require any treatment. For\\nserious arrhythmias, treating the underlying heart diseasesometimes controls the arrhythmia. In some cases, thearrhythmia itself is treated with drugs, electrical shock ( car-\\ndioversion ), automatic implantable defibrillators, artificial\\npacemakers ,catheter ablation , or surgery. Supraventricu-\\nlar arrhythmias often can be treated with drug therapy. Ven-tricular arrhythmias are more complex to treat.\\nDrug therapy can manage many arrhythmias, but\\nfinding the right drug and dose requires care and can takesome time. Common drugs for suppressing arrhythmiasinclude beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers , quini-\\ndine, digitalis preparations, and procainamide. Becauseof their potential serious side effects, stronger, desensi-tizing drugs are used only to treat life-threateningarrhythmias. All of the drugs used to treat arrhythmiashave possible side effects, ranging from mild complica-tions with beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers tomore serious effects of desensitizing drugs that can, para-doxically, cause arrhythmias or make them worse.Response to drugs is usually measured by ECG, Holtermonitor, or electrophysiologic study.\\nIn emergency situations, cardioversion or defibrilla-\\ntion (the application of an electrical shock to the chest\\nwall) is used. Cardioversion restores the heart to its nor-mal rhythm. It is followed by drug therapy to preventrecurrence of the arrhythmia.\\nArtificial pacemakers that send electrical signals to\\nmake the heart beat properly can be implanted under theskin during a simple operation. Leads from the pacemak-er are anchored to the right side of the heart.

High-frequency radio waves are\\nthen used to remove the pathway(s) causing the arrhyth-mia. Surgical ablation is similar in principle but it is per-formed in a hospital, using a cold probe instead of radiowaves to destroy tissue. Ablation treatments are usedwhen medications fail.\\nMaze surgery treats atrial fibrillation by making\\nmultiple incisions through the atrium to allow electricalimpulses to move effectively. This is often recommendedfor patients who have not responded to drugs or car-dioversion.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSince some arrhythmias can be life threatening, a\\nconventional medical doctor should always be consultedfirst. Acupuncture can correct an insignificant number\\n(1.5%) of atrial fibrillation cases. For new, minor arrhyth-mias, acupuncture may be effective in up to 70% of cases,but this figure may not differ much from placebo therapy.Both western and Chinese herbal remedies are also usedin the treatment of arrhythmias. Since hawthorn ( Cratae-\\ngus laevigata ) dilates the blood vessels and stimulates the\\nheart muscle, it may help to stabilize arrhythmias. It isgentle and appropriate for home use, unlike foxglove(Digitalis purpurea ), an herb whose action on the heart is\\ntoo potent for use without supervision by a qualified prac-titioner. Homeopathic practitioners may prescribe reme-dies such as Lachesis and aconite or monkshood ( Aconi-\\ntum napellus ) to treat mild arrhythmias.\\nPrognosis\\nAdvances in diagnostic techniques, new drugs, and\\nmedical technology have extended the lives of manypatients with serious arrhythmias. Diagnostic techniquesenable physicians to accurately identify arrhythmias,while new drugs, advances in pacemaker technology, thedevelopment of implantable defibrillators, and progressin ablative techniques offer effective treatments for manytypes of arrhythmia.\\nPrevention\\nSome arrhythmias can be prevented by managing\\nstress, controlling anxiety , and avoiding caffeine, alco-\\nhol, decongestants, cocaine , and cigarettes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Heart Association.

When the brain isaffected, it is called a stroke . When the heart is involved,\\nit is called a heart attack or myocardial infarction (MI).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA common cause of embolus is when an artery\\nwhose lining has become thickened or damaged, usuallywith age, allows cholesterol to build up more easily thannormal on the artery wall. If some of the cholesterolbreaks off, it forms an embolus. Emboli also commonlyform from blood clots in a heart that has been damagedfrom heart attack or when the heart contracts abnormallyfrom arterial fibrillation.\\nOther known causes are fat cells that enter the blood\\nafter a major bone fracture, infected blood cells, cancer\\ncells that enter the blood stream, and small gas bubbles.\\nSymptoms of an embolus can begin suddenly or build\\nslowly over time, depending on the amount of blockedblood flow.\\nIf the embolus is in an arm or leg, there will be mus-\\ncle pain , numbness or tingling, pale skin color, lower\\ntemperature in the limb, and weakness or loss of musclefunction.

For\\nthis test, patches that detect electrical impulses from theheart are attached to the chest and extremities. The infor-mation is displayed on a monitor screen or a paper tapein the form of waves.

In this procedure, a colored liquid mate-\\nrial (a dye, or contrast material) that can be seen with xrays is injected into the blood stream through a smalltube called a catheter. As the dye fills the arteries, theyare easily seen on x ray motion pictures. If there is ablockage in the artery, it shows up as a sudden cut off inthe movement of contrast material. Angiography is anexpensive procedure and does carry some risk. Thecatheter may cause a blood clot to form, blocking bloodflow. There is also the risk of poking the catheterthrough the artery or heart muscle. Some people maybe allergic to the dye. The risk of any of these injuriesoccurring is small.\\nTreatment\\nArterial embolism can be treated with medication or\\nsurgery, depending on the extent and location of theblockage.\\nMedication to dissolve the clot is usually given\\nthrough a catheter directly into the affected artery.

Normally, oxygenated blood flows tothe tissue through arteries and capillaries. Following therelease of oxygen in the tissues, the blood returns to theheart in veins. An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal con-nection of an artery and a vein. The blood bypasses the cap-illaries and tissues, and returns to the heart. Arterial bloodhas a higher blood pressure than veins and causes swellingof veins involved in a fistula. Although both the artery andthe vein retain their normal connections, the new openingbetween the two will cause some arterial blood to shuntinto the vein because of the blood pressure difference.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are two types of arteriovenous fistulas, congen-\\nital and acquired. A congenital arteriovenous fistula is onethat formed during fetal development. It is a birth defect.KEY TERMS\\nCongenital —Present at the time of birth.\\nIn congenital fistulas, blood vessels of the lower extremity\\nare more frequently involved than other areas of the body.Congenital fistulas are not common. An acquired arteri-ovenous fistula is one that develops after a person is born.It usually occurs when an artery and vein that are side-by-side are damaged and the healing process results in thetwo becoming linked. After catheterizations, arteriovenousfistulas may occur as a complication of the arterial punc-ture in the leg or arm. Fistulas also form without apparentcause. In the case of patients on hemodialysis, physiciansperform surgery to create a fistula. These patients receivemany needle sticks to flush their blood through dialysismachines and for routine blood analysis testing. The veinsused may scar and become difficult to use. Surgery is usedto connect an artery and vein so that arterial blood pressureand flow rate widens the vein and decreases the chance ofblood clots forming inside the vein.\\nThe main symptoms of arteriovenous fistulas near\\nthe surface of the skin are bulging and discolored veins.In some cases, the bulging veins can be mistaken forvaricose veins . Other fistulas can cause more serious\\nproblems depending on their location and the blood ves-sels involved.\\nDiagnosis\\nUsing a stethoscope, a physician can detect the\\nsound of a pulse in the affected vein (bruit). The sound isa distinctive to-and-fro sound. Dye into the blood can betracked by x ray to confirm the presence of a fistula.\\nTreatment\\nSmall arteriovenous fistulas can be corrected by\\nsurgery. Fistulas in the brain or eye are very difficult totreat. If surgery is not possible or very difficult, injectiontherapy may be used. Injection therapy is the injection ofsubstances that cause the blood to clot at the site of theinjection. In the case of an arteriovenous fistula, theblood clot should stop the passage of blood from theartery to the vein. Surgery is usually used to correctacquired fistulas once they are diagnosed.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V . Fuster, eds. The Heart.\\n9th ed.

Lohr, PhD\\nArteriovenous malformations\\nDefinition\\nArteriovenous malformations are blood vessel\\ndefects that occur before birth when the fetus is growingin the uterus (prenatal development). The blood vesselsappear as a tangled mass of arteries and veins. They donot possess the capillary (very fine blood vessels) bedwhich normally exists in the common area where thearteries and veins lie in close proximity (artery-veininterface). An arteriovenous malformation (A VM) mayhemorrhage, or bleed, leading to serious complicationsthat can be life-threatening.\\nDescription\\nA VMs represent an abnormal interface between\\narteries and veins. Normally, arteries carry oxygenatedblood to the body’s tissues through progressively smallerblood vessels. The smallest are capillaries, which form aweb of blood vessels (the capillary bed) through thebody’s tissues. The arterial blood moves through tissuesby these tiny pathways, exchanging its load of oxygenand nutrients for carbon dioxide and other waste productsproduced by the body cells (cellular wastes). The blood iscarried away by progressively larger blood vessels, theveins. A VMs lack a capillary bed and arterial blood ismoved (shunted) directly from the arteries into the veins.\\nA VMs can occur anywhere in the body and have been\\nfound in the arms, hands, legs, feet, lungs, heart, liver, andkidneys. However, 50% of these malformations are locat-ed in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord. Owing to thepossibility of hemorrhaging, such A VMs carry the risk ofstroke ,paralysis , and the loss of speech, memory, or\\nvision. An A VM that hemorrhages can be fatal.\\nApproximately three of every 100,000 people have a\\ncerebral A VM and roughly 40-80% of them will experi-ence some bleeding from the abnormal blood vessels atsome point. The annual risk of an A VM bleeding is esti-mated at about 1-4%. After age 55, the risk of bleedingdecreases. Pre-existing high blood pressure or intensephysical activity do not seem to be associated with A VMhemorrhage, but pregnancy and labor could cause a rup-\\nture or breaking open of a blood vessel. An A VM hemor-rhage is not as dangerous as an aneurysmal rupture. (Ananeurysm is a swollen, blood filled vessel where thepressure of the blood causes the wall to bulge outward.)There is an approximate 10% fatality rate associated withA VM hemorrhage, compared to a 50% fatality rate forruptured aneurysms.\\nAlthough A VMs are congenital defects, meaning a\\nperson is born with them, they are rarely discoveredbefore age 20. A genetic link has been proposed for someA VMs, but studies are only suggestive, not positive. Themajority of A VMs are discovered in people age 20-40.Medical researchers estimate that the malformations arecreated during days 45-60 of fetal development. A sec-ond theory suggests that A VMs are primitive structuresthat are left over from the period when fetal blood circu-lating systems began to develop.\\nHowever they form, A VMs have blood vessels that\\nare abnormally fragile. The arteries that feed into themalformation are unusually swollen and thin walled.They lack the usual amount of smooth muscle tissue andelastin, a fibrous connective tissue. These blood vesselscommonly accumulate deposits of calcium salts andhyalin. The venous part of the malformation receivesblood directly from the artery. Without the interveningcapillary bed, the veins receive blood at a higher pressurethan they were designed to handle. This part of the mal-formation is also swollen (dilated) and thin walled. Thereis a measurable risk of an aneurysm forming near anA VM, increasing the threat of hemorrhage, brain dam-age, and death . Approximately 10-15% of A VMs are\\naccompanied by saccular aneurysms, a type of aneurysmthat looks like a small sac attached to the outer wall ofthe blood vessel.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 357Arteriovenous malformations\\nArteriovenous malformations.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 371}, page_content='Although the malformation itself lacks capillaries,\\nthere is often an abnormal proliferation of capillariesnext to the defect. These blood vessels feed into the mal-formation, causing it to grow larger in some cases. As theA VM receives more blood through this “steal,” adjacentbrain tissue does not receive enough. These areas showabnormal nerve cell growth, cell death, and deposits ofcalcium in that area (calcification). Nerve cells within themalformation may demonstrate abnormal growth and arebelieved to be nonfunctional.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMost people do not realize that they have an A VM\\nunless it hemorrhages enough to produce symptoms.Small A VMs are more likely to hemorrhage. If a hemor-rhage occurs, it produces a sudden, severe headache .\\nThe headache may be focused in one specific area or itmay be more general. It can be mistaken for a migrainein some cases. The headache is accompanied by othersymptoms, such as vomiting, a stiff neck, sleepiness,lethargy, confusion, irritability, or weakness anywhere inthe body. Seizures occur in about a quarter of A VMcases. A person may experience decreased, double, orblurred vision. Hemorrhaging from an A VM is generallyless dangerous than hemorrhaging from an aneurysm,with a survival rate of 80-90%.\\nOther symptoms occur less frequently, but some-\\ntimes appear alongside major symptoms such as the sud-den severe headache. Additional warning signs of ableeding A VM are impaired speech or smell, fainting ,\\nfacial paralysis, a drooping eyelid, dizziness , and ringing\\nor buzzing in the ears.\\nAlthough large A VMs are less likely to hemorrhage,\\nthey can induce symptoms based on their mass alone.Large A VMs exert pressure against brain tissue, causeabnormal development in the surrounding brain tissue,and slow down or block blood flow. Hydrocephalus ,a\\nswelling of brain tissue caused by accumulated fluids,may develop. The warning signs associated with a largenon-bleeding A VM are similar to the symptoms of asmall malformation that is bleeding. Unexplainedheadaches, seizures, dizziness, and neurological symp-toms, such as sensory changes, are signals that demandmedical attention.\\nDiagnosis\\nBased on the clinical symptoms such as severe\\nheadache and neurological problems, and after a com-plete neurologic exam , a computed tomography scan\\n(CT) of the head will be done. In some cases, a whoosh-ing sound from arteries in the neck or over the eye or jaw(called a bruit), can be heard with a stethoscope. The CTscan will reveal whether there has been bleeding in the\\nbrain and can identify A VMs larger than 1 inch (2.5 cm).Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also used to\\nidentify an A VM. A lumbar puncture, or spinal tap, mayfollow the MRI or CT scan. A lumbar puncture involvesremoving a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid from thelower part of the spine. Blood cells or blood breakdownproducts in the cerebrospinal fluid indicate bleeding.\\nTo pinpoint where the blood is coming from, a cere-\\nbral angiography is done. This procedure uses x rays to\\nmap out the blood vessels in the brain, including the ves-sels that feed into the malformation. The informationgained from angiography complements the MRI andhelps distinguish the precise location of the A VM.\\nTreatment\\nNeurosurgeons consider several factors before\\ndeciding on a treatment option. There is some debateover whether or not to treat A VMs that have not rup-tured and are not causing any symptoms. The risks andbenefits of proceeding with treatment need to be mea-sured on an individual basis, taking into account factorssuch as the person’s age and general health, as well asthe A VM’s size and location. Several treatment optionsare available, both for symptomatic or asymptomaticA VMs. These treatment options may be used alone or incombination.\\nSurgery\\nRemoving the A VM is the surest way of preventing\\nit from causing future problems. Both small and largeA VMs can be handled in surgery. Surgery is recommend-ed for superficial A VMs, but may be too dangerous fordeep or very large A VMs. Unless it is an emergency situ-ation, an A VM that has hemorrhaged is treated conserva-tively for several weeks. Conservative treatment consistsof managing the immediate symptoms and allowing thepatient’s condition to stabilize. Surgery requires generalanesthesia and a longer period of recuperation than anyother treatment option.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation is particularly useful to treat small (under\\n1 in) malformations that are deep within the brain. Ioniz-ing radiation is directed at the malformation, destroyingthe A VM without damaging the surrounding tissue. Radi-ation treatment is accomplished in a single session and itis not necessary to open the skull. However, success canonly be measured over the course of the following twoyears. A year after the procedure, 50-75% of treatedA VMs are completely blocked; two years after radiationtreatment, the percentage increases to 85-95%.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 358Arteriovenous malformationsGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 358'),\n",

This technique does not require opening theskull to expose the brain and can be used to treat deepA VMs. Using x-ray images as a guide, a catheter isthreaded through the artery in the thigh (femoral artery) tothe affected area. The patient remains awake during theprocedure and medications can be administered to pre-vent discomfort. The blood vessel leading into the A VMis assessed for its importance to the rest of the brainbefore a balloon or other blocking agent is inserted via thecatheter. The block chokes off the blood supply to themalformation. There may be a mild headache or nauseaassociated with the procedure, but patients may resumenormal activities after leaving the hospital.

The most com-\\nmonly studied joints are the knee and shoulder.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients who are pregnant or may be pregnant\\nshould not have this procedure unless the benefits of thefindings outweigh the risk of radiation exposure. Patientswho are known to be allergic to iodine need to discussthis complication with their physician. Patients who havea known allergy to shellfish are more likely to be allergicto iodine contrast.\\nDescription\\nArthrograpy may be referred to as “joint radiography”\\nor “x rays of the joint.” The term arthrogram may be usedinterchangeably with arthrography. The joint area will becleaned and a local anesthetic will be injected into the tis-sues around the joint to reduce pain. Next, if fluids are pre-sent in the joint, the physician may suction them out (aspi-rate) with a needle. These fluids may be sent to a laborato-ry for further study. Contrast agents are then injected intothe joint through the same location by attaching the aspi-rating needle to a syringe containing the contrast medium.The purpose of contrast agents in x-ray procedures is tohelp highlight details of areas under study by making themopaque. Agents for arthrography are generally air andwater-soluble dyes, the most common containing iodine.Air and iodine may be used together or independently.After the contrast agent is administered, the site of injec-tion will be sealed and the patient may be asked to movethe joint around to distribute the contrast.\\nBefore the contrast medium can be absorbed by the\\njoint itself, several films will be quickly taken under theguidance of the fluoroscope. The patient will be asked tomove the joint into a series of positions, keeping still\\nbetween positioning. Sometimes, the patient will experiencesome tingling or discomfort during the procedure, which isnormal and due to the contrast. Following fluoroscopictracking of the contrast, standard x rays of the area may alsobe taken. The entire procedure will last about one hour.\\nPreparation\\nIt is important to discuss any known sensitivity to\\nlocal anesthetics or iodine prior to this procedure. Aphysician should explain the procedure and the risksassociated with contrast agents and ask the patient to signan informed consent. If iodine contrast will be adminis-tered, the patient may be instructed not to eat before theexam. The timeframe of fasting may extend from only\\n90 minutes prior to the exam up to the night before.There is no other preparation necessary.\\nAftercare\\nThe affected joint should be rested for approximate-\\nly 12 hours following the procedure. The joint may bewrapped in an elastic bandage and the patient shouldreceive instructions on the care and changing of the ban-dage. Noises in the joint such as cracking or clicking arenormal for a few days following arthrography. Thesenoises are the result of liquid in the joints. Swelling mayalso occur and can be treated with application of ice orcold packs. A mild pain reliever can be used to lessenpain in the first few days. However, if any of these symp-toms persist for more than a few days, patients areadvised to contact their physician.\\nRisks\\nIn some patients iodine can cause allergic reactions,\\nranging from mild nausea to severe cardiovascular ornervous system complications. Since the contrast dye isput into a joint, rather than into a vein, allergic reactionsare rare. Facilities licensed to perform contrast examsshould meet requirements for equipment, supplies andstaff training to handle a possible severe reaction.

X rays canpenetrate most structures.Purpose\\nThe goal of arthroplasty is to restore the function of a\\nstiffened joint and relieve pain. Two types of arthroplasticsurgery exist. Joint resection involves removing a portionof the bone from a stiffened joint, creating a gap betweenthe bone and the socket, to improve the range of motion.Scar tissue eventually fills the gap. Pain is relieved andmotion is restored, but the joint is less stable.\\nInterpositional reconstruction is surgery to reshape\\nthe joint and add a prosthetic disk between the two bonesforming the joint. The prosthesis can be made of plasticand metal or from body tissue such as fascia and skin.When interpositional reconstruction fails, total joint\\nreplacement may be necessary. Joint replacement is also\\ncalled total joint arthroplasty.\\nIn recent years, joint replacement has become the oper-\\nation of choice for most knee and hip problems. Elbow,shoulder, ankle, and finger joints are more likely to be treat-ed with joint resection or interpositional reconstruction.\\nArthroplasty is performed on people suffering from\\nsevere pain and disabling joint stiffness that result fromosteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis . Joint resection,\\nrather than joint replacement, is more likely to be per-formed on people with rheumatoid arthritis, especiallywhen the elbow joint is involved. Total joint replacementis usually reserved for people over the age of 60.\\nPrecautions\\nIf both the bone and socket of a joint are damaged,\\njoint replacement is usually the preferred treatment.\\nDescription\\nArthroplasty is performed under general or regional\\nanesthesia in a hospital, by an orthopedic surgeon. Cer-tain medical centers specialize in joint surgery and tendto have higher success rates than less specialized centers.\\nIn joint resection, the surgeon makes an incision at\\nthe joint, then carefully removes minimum amount ofbone necessary to allow free motion. The more bone thatremains, the more stable the joint. Ligament attachmentsare preserved as much as possible. In interpositionalreconstruction, both bones of the joint are reshaped, anda disk of material is placed between the bones to preventtheir rubbing together. Length of hospital stay dependson which joint is treated, but is normally only a few days.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to arthroplasty, all the standard preoperative\\nblood and urine tests are performed.

After making an incision about the size of abuttonhole in the patient’s skin, a sterile sodium chloridesolution is injected to distend the joint. The arthroscope,an instrument the size of a pencil, is then inserted into thejoint. The arthroscope has a lens and a lighting systemthrough which the structures inside the joint are transmit-ted to a miniature television camera attached to the endof the arthroscope. The surgeon uses irrigation and suc-tion to remove blood and debris from the joint beforeexamining it. Other incisions may be made in order tosee other parts of the joint or to insert additional instru-ments. Looking at the interior of the joint on the televi-sion screen, the surgeon can then determine the amountor type of injury and, if necessary, take a biopsy speci-men or repair or correct the problem. Arthroscopicsurgery can be used to remove floating bits of cartilageand treat minor tears and other disorders. When the pro-cedure is finished, the arthroscope is removed and thejoint is irrigated. The site of the incision is bandaged.\\nArthroscopic surgery is used to diagnose and treat\\njoint problems, most commonly in the knee, but also in theshoulder, elbow, ankle, wrist, and hip. Some of the mostcommon joint problems seen with an arthroscope are:\\n• inflammation in the knee, shoulder, elbow, wrist, or ankle• injuries to the shoulder (rotator cuff tendon tears,\\nimpingement syndrome, and recurrent dislocations),knee (cartilage tears, wearing down of or injury to thecartilage cushion, and anterior cruciate ligament tearswith instability), and wrist ( carpal tunnel syndrome )\\n• loose bodies of bone and/or cartilage in the knee, shoul-\\nder, elbow, ankle, or wrist\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 362Arthroscopic surgeryGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:42 PM  Page 362'),\n",

The procedure is performed byinserting a specifically designed illuminated device intothe joint through a small incision. This instrument iscalled an arthroscope. The procedure of arthroscopy isprimarily associated with the process of diagnosis. How-ever, when actual repair is performed, the procedure iscalled arthroscopic surgery .\\nPurpose\\nArthroscopy is used primarily by doctors who special-\\nize in treating disorders of the bones and related structures(orthopedics) to help diagnose joint problems. Oncedescribed as essential for those who primarily care for ath-letic injuries, arthroscopy is now a technique commonlyused by orthopedic surgeons for the treatment of patients ofall ages. This procedure is most commonly used to diagnoseknee and shoulder problems, although the elbow, hip, wrist,and ankle may also be examined with an arthroscope.\\nA joint is a complex system. Within a joint, ligaments\\nattach bones to other bones, tendons attach muscles tobones, cartilage lines and helps protect the ends of bones,and a special fluid (synovial fluid) cushions and lubricatesthe structures. Looking inside the joint allows the doctorsto see exactly which structures are damaged. Arthroscopyalso permits earlier diagnosis of many types of joint prob-lems which had been difficult to detect in previous years.\\nPrecautions\\nMost arthroscopic procedures today are performed\\nin same-day surgery centers where the patient is admittedjust before surgery. A few hours following the procedure,the patient is allowed to return home, although usuallysomeone else must drive. Depending on the type of anes-thesia used, the patient may be told not to eat for severalhours before arriving. Before the procedure, the anesthe-siologist will ask if the patient has any known allergies\\nto local or general anesthetics.

The patient’s cardiacstatus should always be monitored in the event that anycardiac abnormalities arise during the arthroscopy.\\nDescription\\nThe arthroscope is an instrument used to look direct-\\nly into the joint. It contains magnifying lenses and glass-coated fibers that send concentrated light into the joint. Acamera attached to the arthroscope allows the surgeon tosee a clear image of the joint. This image is then trans-ferred to a monitor located in the operating room at thetime of the arthroscopy. This video technology is alsoimportant for documentation of the arthroscopic proce-dure. For example, if the surgeon decides after the arthro-scopic examination that a conventional approach to sur-gically expose or “open” the joint (arthrotomy) must beused, a good photographic record will be useful when thesurgeon returns to execute the final surgical plan.The procedure requires the surgeon to make several\\nsmall incisions (portals) through the skin’s surface intothe joint. Through one or two of the portals, a large-boreneedle, called a cannula, is attached to tubing and insertedinto the joint. The joint is inflated with a sterile salinesolution to expand the joint and ensure clear arthroscopicviewing. Often, following a recent traumatic injury to ajoint, the joint’s natural fluid may be cloudy, making inte-rior viewing of the joint difficult. In this condition, a con-stant flow of the saline solution is necessary. This inflowof saline solution may be through the cannula with theoutflow through the arthroscope, or the positions may bereversed. The arthroscope is placed through one of theportals to view and evaluate the condition of the joint.\\nPreparation\\nBefore an arthroscopy can take place, the surgeon\\ncompletes a thorough medical history and evaluation.Important for the accuracy of this diagnostic procedure, a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 365Arthroscopy\\nArthroscope\\nSuperolateral Superomedial\\nCommon entry sites for the arthroscopeInferomedial\\nCentralMedial Lateral\\nInferolateral\\nArthroscopy is primarily used to help diagnose joint problems.This procedure, most commonly associated with knee and\\nshoulder problems, allows accurate examination and diagnosis of damaged joint ligaments, surfaces, and other related jointstructures.The illustration above indicates the most common entry sites, or portals, in knee arthroscopy.

This is always an important preliminary step,because pain can often be referred to a joint from another\\narea of the body. Anatomical models and pictures are use-ful aids to explain to the patient the proposed arthroscopyand what the surgeon may be looking at specifically.\\nProper draping of the body part is important to pre-\\nvent contamination from instruments used in arthroscopy,such as the camera, light cords, and inflow and outflowdrains placed in the portals. Draping packs used inarthroscopy include disposable paper gowns and drapeswith adhesive backing. The surgeon may also place atourniquet above the joint to temporarily block blood flowto the area during the arthroscopic exam.\\nGeneral or local anesthesia may be used during\\narthroscopy. Local anesthesia is usually used because itreduces the risk of lung and heart complications andallows the patient to go home sooner. The local anesthet-ic may be injected in small amounts in multiple locationsin skin and joint tissues in a process called infiltration. Inother cases, the anesthetic is injected into the spinal cordor a main nerve supplying the area. This process is calleda “block,” and it blocks all sensation below the maintrunk of the nerve. For example, a femoral block anes-thetizes the leg from the thigh down (its name comesfrom femur, the thighbone). Most patients are comfort-able once the skin, muscles, and other tissues around thejoint are numbed by the anesthetic; however, somepatients are also given a sedative if they express anxiety\\nabout the procedure. (It’s important for the patient toremain still during the arthroscopic examination.)\\nGeneral anesthesia, in which the patient becomes\\nunconcious, may be used if the procedure may be unusu-ally complicated or painful. For example, people whohave relatively “tight” joints may be candidates for gen-eral anesthesia because the procedure may take longerand cause more discomfort.\\nAftercare\\nThe portals are closed by small tape strips or stitches\\nand covered with dressings and a bandage. The patientspends a short amount of time in the recovery room afterarthroscopy. Most patients can go home after about anhour in the recovery room. Pain medication may be pre-scribed for a short period; however, many patients findvarious over-the-counter pain relievers sufficient.\\nFollowing the surgical procedure, the patient needs\\nto be aware of the signs of infection, which include red-ness, warmth, excessive pain, and swelling. The risk ofinfection increases if the incisions become wet too earlyfollowing surgery. Because of this, it is good practice to\\ncover the joint with plastic (for example, a plastic bag)while showering after arthroscopy.\\nThe use of crutches is commonplace after arthro-\\nscopy, with progression to independent walking on an “astolerated” basis by the patient. Generally, a rehabilitation\\nprogram, supervised by a physical therapist, follows short-ly after the arthroscopy to help the patient regain mobilityand strength of the affected joint and limb.\\nRisks\\nThe incidence of complications is low compared to\\nthe high number of arthroscopic procedures performedevery year. Possible complications include infection,swelling, damage to the tissues in the joint, blood clots inthe leg veins ( thrombophlebitis ), leakage of blood into\\nthe joint (hemarthrosis), blood clots that move to the lung(pulmonary embolus), and injury to the nerves aroundthe joint.\\nNormal results\\nThe goal of arthroscopy is to diagnose a joint prob-\\nlem causing pain and/or restrictions in normal joint func-tion. For example, arthroscopy can be a useful tool inlocating a tear in the joint surface of the knee or locatinga torn ligament of the shoulder. Arthroscopic examina-tion is often followed by arthroscopic surgery performedto repair the problem with appropriate arthroscopic tools.The final result is to decrease pain, increase joint mobili-ty, and thereby improve the overall quality of thepatient’s activities of daily living.\\nAbnormal results\\nLess optimal results that may require further treat-\\nment include adhesive capsulitis. In this condition, thejoint capsule that naturally forms around the jointbecomes thickened, forming adhesions. This results in astiff and less mobile joint. This problem is frequentlycorrected by manipulation and mobilization of the jointwith the patient placed under general anesthesia.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCasscells, Ward S.

Masks, ritual pottery, costumes, otherobjects used in rituals, cave drawings, Egyptian hiero-glyphics, and Celtic art and symbols are all visualrecords of self-expression and communication throughart. Art has also been associated spiritual power, andartistic forms such as the Hindu and Buddhist mandalaand Native American sand painting are considered pow-erful healing tools.\\nIn the late nineteenth century, French psychiatrists\\nAmbrose Tardieu and Paul-Max Simon both publishedstudies on the similar characteristics of and symbolism inthe artwork of the mentally ill. Tardieu and Simonviewed art therapy as an effective diagnostic tool to iden-tify specific types of mental illness or traumatic events.Later, psychologists would use this diagnostic aspect todevelop psychological drawing tests (the Draw-A-Mantest, the Draw-A-Person Questionnaire [DAP.Q]) andprojective personality tests involving visual symbolrecognition (e.g., the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the The-\\nmatic Apperception Test [TAT], and the Holtzman\\nInkblot Test [HIT]).\\nThe growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy-\\nchiatric institutions in the twentieth century was animportant factor in the development of art therapy in the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 367Art therapyGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 367'),\n",

Milieu therapies (or environmental thera-\\npy) focus on putting the patient in a controlled therapeu-tic social setting that provides the patient with opportuni-ties to gain self-confidence and interact with peers in apositive way. Activities that encourage self-discoveryand empowerment such as art, music, dance, and writingare important components of this approach.\\nEducator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was a\\nfollower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated art intopsychotherapy as a means for her patients to visualize andrecognize the unconscious. She founded the WaldenSchool in 1915, where she used students’ artworks in psy-chological counseling. She published extensively on thesubject and taught seminars on the technique at New YorkUniversity in the 1950s. Today, she is considered thefounder of art therapy in the United States.\\nIn the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger\\nintroduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-basedpsychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men-ninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residencein the following years, and the facility was also consid-ered a leader in the art therapy movement through the1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers whoemerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, HannaYaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental Health),and Janie Rhyne.\\nArt therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art\\npsychology, encourages self-discovery and emotionalgrowth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre-ation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted inFreud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious andunconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption thatvisual symbols and images are the most accessible andnatural form of communication to the human experience.Patients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, thethoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. Theresulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter-preted by the patient.\\nThe “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera-\\npy typically allows patients to gain some level of insightinto their feelings and lets them to work through theseissues in a constructive manner. Art therapy is typicallypracticed with individual, group, or family psychothera-py (talk therapy). While a therapist may provide criticalguidance for these activities, a key feature of effective arttherapy is that the patient/artist, not the therapist, directsthe interpretation of the artwork.\\nArt therapy can be a particularly useful treatment\\ntool for children, who frequently have limited languageskills. By drawing or using other visual means to expresstroublesome feelings, younger patients can begin toaddress these issues, even if they cannot identify or labelthese emotions with words. Art therapy is also valuable\\nfor adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling totalk about thoughts and feelings.\\nBeyond its use in mental health treatment, art thera-\\npy is also used with traditional medicine to treat organicdiseases and conditions. The connection between mentaland physical health is well documented, and art therapycan promote healing by relieving stress and allowing thepatient to develop coping skills.\\nArt therapy has traditionally centered on visual\\nmediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Somemental healthcare providers have now broadened the def-inition to include music, film, dance, writing, and othertypes of artistic expression.\\nArt therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatient\\nor outpatient treatment program, and can take place inindividual or group therapy sessions. Group art therapy\\nsessions often take place in hospital, clinic, shelter, andcommunity program settings. These group therapy ses-sions can have the added benefits of positive social inter-action, empathy, and support from peers. The client-artistcan learn that others have similar concerns and issues.\\nPreparations\\nBefore starting art therapy, the therapist may have an\\nintroductory session with the client-artist to discuss arttherapy techniques and give the client the opportunity toask questions about the process. The client-artist’s comfortwith the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.\\nThe therapist ensures that appropriate materials and\\nspace are available for the client-artist, as well as an ade-quate amount of time for the session. If the individualartist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of atrained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time arestill important factors in a successful creative experience.\\nThe supplies used in art therapy are limited only by\\nthe artist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of thematerials often used include paper, canvas, poster board,assorted paints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks,fabrics, string, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bend-able metals, and natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.).Providing artists with a variety of materials in assortedcolors and textures can enhance their interest in theprocess and may result in a richer, more diverse explo-ration of their emotions in the resulting artwork. Appro-priate tools such as scissors, brushes, erasers, easels, sup-ply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons, and cleaningmaterials are also essential.\\nAn appropriate workspace should be available for\\nthe creation of art.

If performed in a therapy group or one-on-one ses-sion, the art therapist should be available to answer gen-eral questions about materials and/or the creativeprocess. However, the therapist should be careful not toinfluence the creation or interpretation of the work.\\nPrecautions\\nArt materials and techniques should match the age\\nand ability of the client. People with impairments, suchas traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological con-dition, may have difficulties with the self-discovery por-tion of the art therapy process depending on their level offunctioning. However, they may still benefit from arttherapy through the sensory stimulation it provides andthe pleasure they get from artistic creation.\\nWhile art is accessible to all (with or without a ther-\\napist to guide the process), it may be difficult to tap thefull potential of the interpretive part of art therapy with-out a therapist to guide the process. When art therapy ischosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical con-dition, it should be treated as a supplemental therapy andnot as a substitute for conventional medical treatments.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nA wide body of literature supports the use of art\\ntherapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mind-body connection between psychological well-being andphysical health is further documented by studies in thefield, art therapy gains greater acceptance by mainstreammedicine as a therapeutic technique for organic illness.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFausek, Diane.

It is not contagious.\\nDescription\\nAsbestosis is a consequence of prolonged exposure\\nto large quantities of asbestos, a material once widelyused in construction, insulation, and manufacturing.When asbestos is inhaled, fibers penetrate the breathingpassages and irritate, fill, inflame, and scar lung tissue. Inadvanced asbestosis,, the lungs shrink, stiffen, andbecome honeycombed (riddled with tiny holes).\\nLegislation has reduced use of asbestos in the United\\nStates, but workers who handle automobile brake shoelinings, boiler insulation, ceiling acoustic tiles, electricalequipment, and fire-resistant materials are still exposedto the substance. Asbestos is used in the production ofpaints and plastics. Significant amounts can be releasedinto the atmosphere when old buildings or boats arerazed or remodeled.\\nAsbestosis is most common in men over 40 who\\nhave worked in asbestos-related occupations. Smokers orheavy drinkers have the greatest risk of developing thisdisease. Between 1968 and 1992, more than 10,000Americans over the age of 15 died as a result of asbesto-sis. Nearly 25% of those who died lived in California or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 369AsbestosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 369'),\n",

Family members candevelop the disease as a result of inhaling particles ofasbestos dust that cling to workers’ clothes.\\nIt is rare for asbestosis to develop in anyone who\\nhasn’t been exposed to large amounts of asbestos on aregular basis for at least 10 years. Symptoms of the dis-ease do not usually appear until 15–20 years after initialexposure to asbestos.\\nThe first symptom of asbestosis is usually shortness\\nof breath following exercise or other physical activity.\\nThe early stages of the disease are also characterized by adry cough and a generalized feeling of illness.\\nAs the disease progresses and lung damage increas-\\nes, shortness of breath occurs even when the patient is atrest. Recurrent respiratory infections and coughing upblood are common. So is swelling of the feet, ankles, orhands. Other symptoms of advanced asbestosis includechest pain , hoarseness, and restless sleep. Patients who\\nhave asbestosis often have clubbed (widened and thick-ened) fingers. Other potential complications includeheart failure , collapsed (deflated) lung, and pleurisy\\n(inflammation of the membrane that protects the lung).\\nDiagnosis\\nScreening of at-risk workers can reveal lung inflamma-\\ntion and lesions characteristic of asbestosis. Patients’ med-ical histories can identify occupations, hobbies, or other sit-\\nuations likely to involve exposure to asbestos fibers.\\nX rays can show shadows or spots on the lungs or an\\nindistinct or shaggy outline of the heart that suggests thepresence of asbestosis. Blood tests are used to measureconcentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pulmonaryfunction tests can be used to assess a patient’s ability toinhale and exhale, and a computed tomography scan(CT) of the lungs can show flat, raised patches associatedwith advanced asbestosis.\\nTreatment\\nThe goal of treatment is to help patients breathe\\nmore easily, prevent colds and other respiratory infec-tions, and control complications associated withadvanced disease. Ultrasonic, cool-mist humidifiers orcontrolled coughing can loosen bronchial secretions.\\nRegular exercise helps maintain and improve lung\\ncapacity. Although temporary bed rest may be recom-mended, patients are encouraged to resume their regularactivities as soon as they can.\\nAntibiotics may be prescribed to combat infection.\\nAspirin or acetominophen (Tylenol) can relieve minor\\ndiscomfort and bronchodilators that are swallowed or\\ninhaled can relax and widen breathing passages.\\nDiuretics (drugs that increase urine production and\\nexcretion) or digitalis glycoside ( Digitalis purpurea ) are\\nprescribed for some patients. Others may need to usesupplemental oxygen or use less salt.\\nAnyone who develops symptoms of asbestosis\\nshould see a family physician or lung disease specialist.A doctor should be notified if someone who has beendiagnosed with asbestosis:\\n• coughs up blood\\n• continues to lose weight\\n• is short of breath• has chest pain• develops a sudden fever of 101°F (38.3°C) or higher\\n• develops unfamiliar, unexplained symptoms\\nPrognosis\\nAsbestosis can’t be cured, but its symptoms can be\\ncontrolled. Doctors don’t know why the health of somepatients deteriorates and the condition of others remainthe same, but believe the difference may be due to vary-ing exposures of asbestos.

This condition can also develop whenintestinal fluids, bile, pancreatic juices, or bacteriainvade or inflame the smooth, transparent membrane thatlines the inside of the abdomen (peritoneum). However,ascites is more often associated with liver disease andother long-lasting (chronic) conditions.\\nTypes of ascites\\nCirrhosis , which is responsible for 80% of all\\ninstances of ascites in the United States, triggers a seriesof disease-producing changes that weaken the kidney’sability to excrete sodium in the urine.\\nPancreatic ascites develops when a cyst that has\\nthick, fibrous walls (pseudocyst) bursts and permits pan-creatic juices to enter the abdominal cavity.\\nChylous ascites has a milky appearance caused by\\nlymph that has leaked into the abdominal cavity.Although chylous ascites is sometimes caused by trau-ma, abdominal surgery, tuberculosis , or another peri-\\ntoneal infection, it is usually a symptom of lymphoma orsome other cancer .\\nCancer causes 10% of all instances of ascites in the\\nUnited States.

It functions to keep fluid inside the\\nblood vessels.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe two most important factors in the production of\\nascites due to chronic liver disease are:\\n• Low levels of albumin in the blood that cause a change\\nin the pressure necessary to prevent fluid exchange(osmotic pressure). This change in pressure allows fluidto seep out of the blood vessels.\\n• An increase in the pressure within the branches of the\\nportal vein that run through liver (portal hypertension ).\\nPortal hypertension is caused by the scarring thatoccurs in cirrhosis. Blood that cannot flow through theliver because of the increased pressure leaks into theabdomen and causes ascites.\\nOther conditions that contribute to ascites develop-\\nment include:\\n• hepatitis• heart or kidney failure• inflammation and fibrous hardening of the sac that con-\\ntains the heart (constrictive pericarditis )Persons who have systemic lupus erythematosus\\nbut do not have liver disease or portal hypertension occa-sionally develop ascites. Depressed thyroid activitysometimes causes pronounced ascites, but inflammationof the pancreas ( pancreatitis ) rarely causes significant\\naccumulations of fluid.\\nSymptoms\\nSmall amounts of fluid in the abdomen do not usual-\\nly produce symptoms. Massive accumulations may cause:\\n• rapid weight gain\\n• abdominal discomfort and distention\\n• shortness of breath• swollen ankles\\nDiagnosis\\nSkin stretches tightly across an abdomen that con-\\ntains large amounts of fluid. The navel bulges or lies flat,and the fluid makes a dull sound when the doctor taps theabdomen. Ascitic fluid may cause the flanks to bulge.\\nPhysical examination generally enables doctors to\\ndistinguish ascites from pregnancy , intestinal gas, obe-\\nsity, or ovarian tumors. Ultrasound or computed tomog-\\nraphy scans (CT) can detect even small amounts of\\nfluid. Laboratory analysis of fluid extracted by insertinga needle through the abdominal wall (diagnostic para-\\ncentesis ) can help identify the cause of the accumulation.\\nTreatment\\nReclining minimizes the amount of salt the kidneys\\nabsorb, so treatment generally starts with bed rest and alow-salt diet. Urine-producing drugs ( diuretics ) may be\\nprescribed if initial treatment is ineffective. The weightand urinary output of patients using diuretics must becarefully monitored for signs of :\\n• hypovolemia (massive loss of blood or fluid)\\n• azotemia (abnormally high blood levels of nitrogen-\\nbearing materials)\\n• potassium imbalance• high sodium concentration. If the patient consumes\\nmore salt than the kidneys excrete, increased doses ofdiuretics should be prescribed\\nModerate-to-severe accumulations of fluid are treat-\\ned by draining large amounts of fluid (large-volumeparacentesis) from the patient’s abdomen. This procedureis safer than diuretic therapy. It causes fewer complica-tions and requires a shorter hospital stay.\\nLarge-volume paracentesis is also the preferred\\ntreatment for massive ascites.

When disease or injury affects these tissues, thecells are destroyed and AST is released into the blood-stream. The amount of AST is directly related to thenumber of cells affected by the disease or injury, but thelevel of elevation depends on the length of time that theblood is tested after the injury. Serum AST levelsbecome elevated eight hours after cell injury, peak at 24-36 hours, and return to normal in three to seven days. Ifthe cellular injury is chronic (ongoing), AST levels willremain elevated.\\nOne of the most important uses for AST determina-\\ntion has formerly been in the diagnosis of a heart attack,or MI. AST can assist in determining the timing andextent of a recent MI, although it is less specific than cre-atine phosphokinase (CPK), CKMB, myglobin, tro-ponins, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH). Assuming nofurther cardiac injury occurs, the AST level rises within6-10 hours after an acute attack, peaks at 12-48 hours,and returns to normal in three to four days. Myocardialinjuries such as angina (chest pain ) or pericarditis\\n(inflammation of the pericardium, the membrane aroundthe heart) do not increase AST levels.\\nAST is also a valuable aid in the diagnosis of liver\\ndisease. Although not specific for liver disease, it canbe used in combination with other enzymes to monitorthe course of various liver disorders. Chronic, silenthepatitis ( hepatitis C ) is sometimes the cause of elevat-\\ned AST. In alcoholic hepatitis, caused by excessivealcohol ingestion, AST values are usually moderatelyelevated; in acute viral hepatitis, AST levels can rise toover 20 times normal. Acute extrahepatic (outside theliver) obstruction (e.g. gallstone), produces AST levelsthat can quickly rise to 10 times normal, and then rapid-ly fall. In cases of cirrhosis , the AST level is related to\\nthe amount of active inflammation of the liver.

Aspergillo-\\nsis fungal infections can occur in the ear canal, eyes,nose, sinus cavities, and lungs. In some individuals, theinfection can even invade bone and the membranes thatenclose the brain and spinal cord ( meningitis ).\\nDescription\\nAspergillosis is primarily an infection of the lungs\\ncaused by the inhalation of airborne spores of the fungusAspergillus . Spores are the small particles that most\\nfungi use to reproduce. Although virtually everyone isexposed to this fungus in their daily environment, itrarely causes disease. When Aspergillus does cause dis-\\nease, however, it usually occurs in those individuals withweakened immune systems (immunocompromised) orwho have a history of respiratory ailments. Because itdoes not present distinctive symptoms, aspergillosis isgenerally thought to be underdiagnosed and underre-ported. Furthermore, many patients with the more severeforms of aspergillosis tend to have multiple, complexhealth problems, such as AIDS or a blood disorder like\\nleukemia, which can further complicate diagnosis andtreatment.\\nOnce considered particularly rare, the incidence of\\nreported aspergillosis has risen somewhat with the devel-opment of more sophisticated methods of diagnosis andadvances made in other areas of medicine, such as withthe increased use of certain chemotherapeutic and corti-costeroid drugs that are extremely useful in treating vari-ous types of cancer but that decrease the individual’s\\nimmune response, making them more susceptible toother diseases like aspergillosis.\\nOur advanced ability to perform tissue and organ\\ntransplants has also increased the number of people vul-nerable to fungal infections. Transplant recipients, partic-ularly those receiving bone marrow or heart transplants,are highly susceptible to Aspergillus , which may be cir-\\nculating in the hospital air.\\nAspergillosis can be a serious, potentially deadly\\nthreat for two primary reasons:\\n• Aspergillosis usually occurs in those individuals who\\nare already ill or have weakened immune systems, suchas patients who have undergone chemotherapy for\\ncancer.\\n• None of the currently available antifungal drugs are\\nreliably effective against Aspergillus .Causes and symptoms\\nAspergillus is a fungus that is found almost everywhere,\\nbut particularly in soil, water, decaying vegetation, andstored grain. The fungus has also been cultured from ventila-tion systems and may be stirred up during building renova-tions. The species most commonly identified in patients withconfirmed disease are A. fumigatus and A. flavus .\\nAirborne Aspergillus spores enter the body primarily\\nthrough inhalation but can also lodge in the ear or eye.Normally functioning immune systems are generally ableto cope without consequent development of aspergillosis.\\nIt is important to make distinctions between the vari-\\nous forms of aspergillosis, as the treatment and prognosisvaries considerably among types. Aspergillosis as a diag-nosis refers to three general forms:\\n• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is\\nseen in patients with long-standing asthma , particular-\\nly in patients taking oral corticosteroids for a long\\nperiod of time. This is usually the least serious andmost treatable form.\\n• Aspergilloma refers to the mass formed when fungal\\nspores settle into or colonize areas of the lung that havebeen pitted and scarred as a result of tuberculosis or\\nprior pneumonia . There are several available treatments,\\nalthough the success rate varies with each treatment.\\n• Invasive fungal infection refers to rare cases in which\\nthe fungus spreads throughout the body via the bloodstream and invades other organ systems. Once estab-lished, invasive fungal infections are extremely difficultto cure and, as a result, the associated death rate is\\nextremely high.\\nAspergillus infection of the ear (called otomycosis),\\ncan produce itching and a discharge, sometimes noticed\\nas a spot on the pillow. Fungal infection of the cornea ofthe eye in a susceptible person can result in blindness, ifnot diagnosed and treated promptly.\\nDiagnosis\\nAspergillosis can be quite difficult to diagnose\\nbecause the symptoms, such as coughing and wheezing ,\\nif present at all, are common to many respiratory disor-ders. Furthermore, blood and sputum cultures are notvery helpful. The presence of Aspergillus is so common,\\neven in asthmatics, that a positive culture alone is insuffi-cient for a diagnosis. Other, potentially more useful,screening tools include examining the sample obtainedafter repeatedly washing the bronchial tubes of the lungwith water (bronchial lavage), but examining a tissuesample (biopsy) is the most reliable diagnostic tool.Researchers are currently attempting to develop a practi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 375AspergillosisGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 375'),\n",

Brown flecks\\nor clumps may be seen in the sputum. Pulmonary func-tion tests may show decreased blood flow, suggesting anobstruction within the lungs. Elevated blood levels of anantibody produced in response to Aspergillus and of cer-\\ntain immune system cells may indicate a specific aller-gic-type immune system response.\\nA fungal mass (aspergilloma) in the lung usually\\ndoes not produce clear symptoms and is generally diag-nosed when seen on chest x rays. However, 70% or moreof patients spit up blood from the lungs ( hemoptysis ) at\\nleast once, and this may become repetitive and serious.Hemoptysis, then, is another indication that the patientmay be suffering from an aspergilloma.\\nIn patients with lowered immune systems who are at\\nrisk for developing invasive aspergillosis, the physicianmay use a combination of blood culture with visual diag-\\nnostic techniques, such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT) and radiography, to arrive at a likely diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment method selected depends on the form\\nof aspergillosis. ABPA can usually be treated with manyof the same drugs used to treat asthma, such as systemic\\nsteroids. Long-term therapy may be required, however, toprevent recurrence. Antifungal agents are not recom-mended in the treatment of ABPA. In cases of aspergillo-ma, it may become necessary to surgically remove orreduce the size of a fungal mass, especially if the patientcontinues to spit up blood. In aspergillosis cases affectingthe nose and nasal sinuses, surgery may also be required.\\nIn non-ABPA cases, the use of antifungal drugs may\\nbe indicated. In such cases, amphotericin B (Fungizone)is the first-line therapy. The prescribed dose will dependon the patient’s condition but usually begins with a smalltest dose and then escalates. Less than one-third ofpatients are likely to respond to amphotericin B, and itsside effects often limit its use. For patients who do notrespond to oral amphotericin B, another option is a dif-ferent formulation of the same drug called liposomalamphotericin B.\\nFor patients who fail to respond or who cannot toler-\\nate amphotericin B, another drug called itraconazole(Sporanox), given 400-600 mg daily, has also beenapproved. Treatment generally lasts about 3 months. Giv-ing itraconazole can produce adverse reactions if pre-scribed in combination with certain other drugs byincreasing the concentrations of both drugs in the bloodand creating a potentially life-threatening situation. Evenantacids can significantly affect itraconazole levels. As a\\nresult, drug levels must be continually monitored toensure that absorption is occurring at acceptable levels.\\nTwo other methods of treatment are being studied:\\ndirect instillation of an antifungal agent into the lungsand administration of antifungals using a nebulizer.Instilling or injecting amphotericin B or itraconazoledirectly into the lung cavity or into the fungal ball(aspergilloma) itself has been helpful in stoppingepisodes of hemoptysis, but not in preventing futurerecurrences. Furthermore, many patients with aspergillo-mas are poor risks for surgery because their lung func-tion is already compromised. As a result, instillation of afungal agent should only be considered in those whohave significant hempotysis.\\nA popular method of treating some respiratory dis-\\norders is to add a liquid drug to another carrier liquid andaerosolize or produce a fine mist that can be inhaled intothe lungs through a device called a nebulizer.

Other members of this group include sodium salicy-late, choline salicylate, and magnesium salicylate. Thesedrugs are more expensive and no more effective thanaspirin. However, they are a little easier on the stomach.Aspirin is quickly absorbed into the bloodstream and pro-vides quick and relatively long-lasting pain relief. Aspirinalso reduces inflammation. Researchers believe theseeffects come about because aspirin blocks the productionof pain-producing chemicals called prostaglandins.\\nIn addition to relieving pain and reducing inflamma-\\ntion, aspirin also lowers fever by acting on the part of thebrain that regulates temperature.

Obstruction to air flow either stops sponta-\\nneously or responds to a wide range of treatments, butcontinuing inflammation makes the airways hyper-responsive to stimuli such as cold air, exercise , dust\\nmites, pollutants in the air, and even stress and anxiety .\\nDescription\\nAbout 10 million Americans have asthma, and the\\nnumber seems to be increasing. Between 1982-92, therate actually rose by 42%. Not only is asthma becomingmore frequent, but it also is a more severe disease thanbefore, despite modern drug treatments. In the same 10-year period, the death rate from asthma in the United\\nStates increased by 35%.\\nThe changes that take place in the lungs of asth-\\nmatic persons makes the airways (the “breathing tubes,”or bronchi and the smaller bronchioles ) hyper-reactive\\nto many different types of stimuli that don’t affecthealthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the muscle tissue inthe walls of bronchi go into spasm, and the cells liningthe airways swell and secrete mucus into the air spaces.Both these actions cause the bronchi to become nar-rowed (bronchoconstriction). As a result, an asthmaticperson has to make a much greater effort to breathe inair and to expel it.\\nCells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells,\\nrelease certain substances that cause the bronchial mus-cle to contract and stimulate mucus formation. Thesesubstances, which include histamine and a group ofchemicals called leukotrienes, also bring white bloodcells into the area, which is a key part of the inflammato-ry response. Many patients with asthma are prone toreact to such “foreign” substances as pollen, house dustmites, or animal dander; these are called allergens. Onthe other hand, asthma affects many patients who are not“allergic” in this way.\\nAsthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence,\\nbut it also may first appear during adult years. While thesymptoms may be similar, certain important aspects ofasthma are different in children and adults.\\nChild-onset asthma\\nWhen asthma does begin in childhood, it often does\\nso in a child who is likely, for genetic reasons, to becomesensitized to common “allergens” in the environment(atopic person). When these children are exposed tohouse-dust mites, animal proteins, fungi, or other poten-tial allergens, they produce a type of antibody that isintended to engulf and destroy the foreign materials. Thishas the effect of making the airway cells sensitive to par-ticular materials. Further exposure can lead rapidly to anasthmatic response. This condition of atopy is present in\\nat least one-third and as many as half of the general pop-ulation. When an infant or young child wheezes duringviral infections, the presence of allergy (in the child itselfor a close relative) is a clue that asthma may well contin-ue throughout childhood.\\nAdult-onset asthma\\nAllergenic materials may also play a role when\\nadults become asthmatic. Asthma can actually start atany age and in a wide variety of situations. Many adultswho are not allergic do have such conditions as sinusitis\\nor nasal polyps , or they may be sensitive to aspirin and\\nrelated drugs. Another major source of adult asthma isexposure at work to animal products, certain forms ofplastic, wood dust, or metals.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller-\\ngen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissuechanges leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon-striction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at leastminimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat-ing asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irritantis causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once asthmais present, symptoms can be set off or made worse if thepatient also has rhinitis (inflammation of the lining of\\nthe nose) or sinusitis. When, for some reason, stomachacid passes back up the esophagus (acid reflux), this canalso make asthma worse. A viral infection of the respira-tory tract can also inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirinand a type of drug called beta-blockers, often used totreat high blood pressure, can also worsen the symptomsof asthma.\\nThe most important inhaled allergens giving rise to\\nattacks of asthma are:\\n• animal dander• mites in house dust• fungi (molds) that grow indoors• cockroach allergens\\n• pollen\\n• occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles\\nof industrial materials in the air\\nInhaling tobacco smoke, either by smoking or being\\nnear people who are smoking, can irritate the airwaysand trigger an asthmatic attack. Air pollutants can have asimilar effect. In addition, there are three important fac-tors that regularly produce attacks in certain asthmaticpatients, and they may sometimes be the sole cause ofsymptoms. They are:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 380AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 380'),\n",

Besides wheezingand being short of breath, the patient may cough and\\nmay report a feeling of “tightness” in the chest. Childrenmay have itching on their back or neck at the start of an\\nattack. Wheezing is often loudest when the patientbreathes out, in an attempt to expel used air through thenarrowed airways. Some asthmatics are free of symp-toms most of the time but may occasionally be short ofbreath for a brief time. Others spend much of their days(and nights) coughing and wheezing, until properly treat-ed. Crying or even laughing may bring on an attack.Severe episodes are often seen when the patient gets aviral respiratory tract infection or is exposed to a heavyload of an allergen or irritant. Asthmatic attacks may lastonly a few minutes or can go on for hours or even days (acondition called status asthmaticus).\\nBeing short of breath may cause a patient to become\\nvery anxious, sit upright, lean forward, and use the mus-cles of the neck and chest wall to help breathe. Thepatient may be able to say only a few words at a timebefore stopping to take a breath. Confusion and a bluishtint to the skin are clues that the oxygen supply is muchtoo low, and that emergency treatment is needed. In asevere attack that lasts for some time, some of the airsacs in the lung may rupture so that air collects withinthe chest. This makes it even harder to breathe in enoughair. Almost always, even patients with the most severeattacks will recover completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nApart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam-\\niner should look for maximum chest expansion whiletaking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neckmuscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasalpolyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are oftennoted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like atopic\\ndermatitis or eczema, are a tipoff that the patient has\\nallergic problems.\\nInquiring about a family history of asthma or aller-\\ngiescan be a valuable indicator of asthma. The diagnosis\\nmay be strongly suggested when typical symptoms andsigns are present. A test called spirometry measures howrapidly air is exhaled and how much is retained in thelungs. Repeating the test after the patient inhales a drugthat widens the air passages (a bronchodilator) will showwhether the airway narrowing is reversible, which is a\\nvery typical finding in asthma. Often patients use a relat-ed instrument, called a peak flow meter, to keep track ofasthma severity when at home.\\nOften, it is difficult to determine what is triggering\\nasthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be used,although an allergic skin response does not always meanthat the allergen being tested is causing the asthma. Also,the body’s immune system produces antibody to fight offthe allergen, and the amount of antibody can be mea-sured by a blood test. This will show how sensitive thepatient is to a particular allergen. If the diagnosis is stillin doubt, the patient can inhale a suspect allergen whileusing a spirometer to detect airway narrowing. Spirome-try can also be repeated after a bout of exercise if exer-cise-induced asthma is a possibility. A chest x ray will\\nhelp rule out other disorders.\\nTreatment\\nPatients should be periodically examined and have\\ntheir lung function measured by spirometry to make surethat treatment goals are being met. These goals are to pre-vent troublesome symptoms, to maintain lung function asclose to normal as possible, and to allow patients to pur-sue their normal activities including those requiring exer-tion. The best drug therapy is that which controls asthmat-ic symptoms while causing few or no side-effects.\\nDrugs\\nMETHYLXANTHINES. The chief methylxanthine drug\\nis theophylline. It may exert some anti-inflammatoryeffect, and is especially helpful in controlling nighttimesymptoms of asthma. When, for some reason, a patientcannot use an inhaler to maintain long-term control, sus-tained-release theophylline is a good alternative. Theblood levels of the drug must be measured periodically,as too high a dose can cause an abnormal heart rhythm orconvulsions.\\nBETA-RECEPTOR AGONISTS. These drugs, which are\\nbronchodilators , are the best choice for relieving sudden\\nattacks of asthma and for preventing attacks from beingtriggered by exercise. Some agonists, such as albuterol,act mainly in lung cells and have little effect on otherorgans, such as the heart. These drugs generally start act-ing within minutes, but their effects last only four to sixhours (although longer-acting forms are being devel-oped). They may be taken by mouth, inhaled, or injected.\\nSTEROIDS. These drugs, which resemble natural\\nbody hormones, block inflammation and are extremelyeffective in relieving symptoms of asthma.

This is the strongest medicine forasthma, and can control even severe cases over the longterm and maintain good lung function. Steroids cancause numerous side-effects, however, including bleed-ing from the stomach, loss of calcium from bones,cataracts in the eye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients\\nusing steroids for lengthy periods may also have prob-lems with wound healing, may gain weight, and may suf-fer mental problems. In children, growth may be slowed.Besides being inhaled, steroids may be taken by mouthor injected, to rapidly control severe asthma.\\nLEUKOTRIENE MODIFIERS. Leukotriene modifiers\\nare a new type of drug that can be used in place ofsteroids, for older children or adults who have a milddegree of asthma that persists. They work by counteract-ing leukotrienes, which are substances released by white\\nblood cells in the lung that cause the air passages to con-strict and promote mucus secretion.\\nOTHER DRUGS. Cromolyn and nedocromil are anti-\\ninflammatory drugs that are often used as initial treatmentto prevent asthmatic attacks over the long term in children.They can also prevent attacks when given before exerciseor when exposure to an allergen cannot be avoided. Theseare safe drugs but are expensive, and must be taken regular-ly even if there are no symptoms. Anti-cholinergic drugs,such as atropine, are useful in controlling severe attackswhen added to an inhaled beta-receptor agonist. They helpwiden the airways and suppress mucus production.\\nIf a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that\\ncannot be avoided and it has been difficult to controlsymptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth try-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 382Asthma\\nIn normal bronchioles the airway\\nis open and unobstructed.\\nDuring an attack, the bronchioles of an\\nasthma sufferer are constricted by bandsof muscle around them.

Typically, increasing amounts of the allergen are\\ninjected over a period of three to five years, so that thebody can build up an effective immune response. Thereis a risk that this treatment may itself cause the airwaysto become narrowed and bring on an asthmatic attack.Not all experts are enthusiastic about immunotherapy,although some studies have shown that it does reduceasthmatic symptoms caused by exposure to house-dustmites, ragweed pollen, and cats.\\nManaging asthmatic attacks\\nA severe asthma attack should be treated as quickly\\nas possible. It is most important for a patient suffering anacute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may benecessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help thepatient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeat-edly or continuously. If the patient does not respondpromptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course ofsteroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make arecurrence less likely.\\nMaintaining control\\nLong-term asthma treatment is based on inhaling a\\nbeta-receptor agonist using a special inhaler that meters thedose. Patients must be instructed in proper use of an inhalerto be sure that it will deliver the right amount of drug. Onceasthma has been controlled for several weeks or months, itis worth trying to cut down on drug treatment, but this mustbe done gradually. The last drug added should be the first tobe reduced. Patients should be seen every one to sixmonths, depending on the frequency of attacks.\\nStarting treatment at home, rather than in hospital,\\nmakes for minimal delay and helps the patient to gain asense of control over the disease. All patients should betaught how to monitor their symptoms so that they willknow when an attack is starting, and those with moderateor severe asthma should know how to use a flow meter.They should also have a written “action plan” to follow ifsymptoms suddenly become worse, including how toadjust their medication and when to seek medical help. Ifmore intense treatment is necessary, it should be contin-ued for several days. Over-the-counter “remedies” shouldbe avoided. When deciding whether a patient should behospitalized, the past history of acute attacks, severity ofsymptoms, current medication, and whether good supportis available at home all must be taken into account.\\nReferral to an asthma specialist should be considered if:\\n• there has been a life-threatening asthma attack or\\nsevere, persistent asthma\\n• treatment for three to six months has not met its goals\\n• some other condition, such as nasal polyps or chronic\\nlung disease, is complicating asthma• special tests, such as allergy skin testing or an allergen\\nchallenge, are needed\\n• intensive steroid therapy has been necessary\\nSpecial populations\\nINFANTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. It is especially\\nimportant to closely watch the course of asthma in youngpatients. Treatment is cut down when possible and ifthere is no clear improvement, some other treatmentshould be tried. If a viral infection leads to severe asth-matic symptoms, steroids may help. The health careprovider should write out an asthma treatment plan forthe child’s school. Asthmatic children often need med-ication at school to control acute symptoms or to preventexercise- induced attacks. Proper management will usu-ally allow a child to take part in play activities. Only as alast resort should activities be limited.\\nTHE ELDERLY. Older persons often have other types of\\nobstructive lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or\\nemphysema . This makes it important to know to what\\nextent the symptoms are caused by asthma. Giving steroidsfor two to three weeks can help determine this. Side-effectsfrom beta-receptor agonist drugs (including a speedingheart and tremor) may be more common in older patients.These patients may benefit from receiving an anti-choliner-gic drug, along with the beta-receptor agonist. If theo-phylline is given, the dose should be limited, as olderpatients are less able to clear this drug from their blood.Steroids should be avoided, as they often make elderlypatients confused and agitated. Steroids may also furtherweaken the bones.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with asthma respond well when the\\nbest drug or combination of drugs is found, and they areable to lead relatively normal lives. More than half ofaffected children stop having attacks by the time theyreach 21 years of age. Many others have less frequentand less severe attacks as they grow older. Urgent mea-sures to control asthma attacks and ongoing treatment toprevent attacks are equally important. A small minorityof patients will have progressively more trouble breath-ing and they run a risk of going into respiratory failure\\nand they must receive intensive treatment.\\nPrevention\\nMinimizing exposure to allergens\\nThere are a number of ways to cut down exposure to\\nthe common allergens and irritants that provoke asthmat-ic attacks, or to avoid them altogether:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 383AsthmaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 383'),\n",

Cramer, MD\\nAstigmatism\\nDefinition\\nAstigmatism is the result of an inability of the\\ncornea to properly focus an image onto the retina. Theresult is a blurred image.\\nDescription\\nThe cornea is the outermost part of the eye. It is a\\ntransparent layer that covers the colored part of the eye(iris), pupil, and lens. The cornea bends light and helps tofocus it onto the retina where specialized cells (photoreceptors) detect light and transmit nerve impulses viathe optic nerve to the brain where the image is formed.The cornea is dome shaped. Any incorrect shaping of thecornea results in an incorrect focusing of the light thatpasses through that part of the cornea. The bending oflight is called refraction and focusing problems with thecornea are called diseases of refraction or refractive dis-orders. Astigmatism is an image distortion that resultsfrom an improperly shaped cornea. Usually the cornea isspherically shaped, like a baseball. However, in astigma-tism the cornea is elliptically shaped, more like a foot-ball. There is a long meridian and a short meridian.These two meridians generally have a constant curvatureand are generally perpendicular to each other (regularastigmatism). Irregular astigmatism may have more thantwo meridians of focus and they may not be 90° apart. Apoint of light, therefore, going through an astigmaticcornea will have two points of focus, instead of one nicesharp image on the retina. This will cause the person tohave blurry vision. What the blur looks like will dependupon the amount and the direction of the astigmatism.

A person\\nwith astigmatism may see the same dot as a blurred ovalor frankfurter-shaped blur.\\nSome cases of astigmatism are caused by problems\\nin the lens of the eye. Minor variations in the curvature ofthe lens can produce minor degrees of astigmatism(lenticular astigmatism). In these patients, the cornea isusually normal in shape. Infants, as a group, have theleast amount of astigmatism. Astigmatism may increaseduring childhood, as the eye is developing.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe main symptom of astigmatism is blurring. Peo-\\nple can also experience headaches and eyestrain. Parentscan notice that a child may have astigmatism when thechild can see some part of a pattern or picture more clear-ly than others. For example, lines going across may seemclearer than lines going up and down.\\nRegular astigmatism can be caused by the weight of\\nthe upper eyelid resting on the eyeball creating distortion,surgical incisions in the cornea, trauma or scarring to thecornea, the presence of tumors in the eyelid, or a develop-mental factor. Irregular astigmatism can be caused by scar-ring or keratoconus. Keratoconus is a condition in whichthe cornea thins and becomes cone shaped. It usuallyoccurs around puberty and is more common in women.\\nAlthough the causes of keratoconus are unknown, it maybe hereditary or a result of chronic eye rubbing, as in peo-ple with allergies . The center of the cone may not be in\\nline with the center of the cornea. Diabetes can play a rolein the development of astigmatism. High blood sugar lev-els can cause shape changes in the lens of the eye. Thisprocess usually occurs slowly and, often, is only noticedwhen the diabetic has started treatment to control theirblood sugar. The return to a more normal blood sugarallows the lens to return to normal and this change issometimes noticed by the patient as farsightedness.Because of this, diabetics should wait until their bloodsugar is under control for at least one month to allowvision to stabilize before being measured for eyeglasses.\\nDiagnosis\\nPatients seek treatment because of blurred vision. A\\nvariety of tests can be used to detect astigmatism duringthe eye exam. The patient may be asked to describe theastigmatic dial, a series of lines that radiate outward froma center. People with astigmatism will see some of thelines more clearly than others. One diagnostic instrumentused is the keratometer. This measures the curvature ofthe central cornea. It measures the amount and directionof the curvature. A corneal topographer can measure alarger area of the cornea. It can measure the central area\\nand mid-periphery of the cornea. A keratoscope projectsa series of concentric light rings onto the cornea. Mis-shapen areas of the cornea are revealed by noting areasof the light pattern that do not appear concentric on thecornea. Because these instruments are measuring thecornea, it is also important to have a refraction in case thelens is also contributing to the astigmatism. The refrac-tion measures the optics or visual status of the eye andthe result is the eyeglass prescription. The refraction iswhen the patient is looking at an eye chart and the doctoris putting different lenses in front of the patient’s eyesand asks which one looks better.\\nTreatment\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical\\nlenses. They can be in eyeglasses or contact lenses. Theunit of measure describing the power of the lens system orlens is called the diopter (D). The lenses are shaped tocounteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are caus-ing the difficulty. Because the correction is in one direction,it is written in terms of the axis the correction is in. On aprescription, for example, it may say -1.00D /H11003180°.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 385Astigmatism\\nCornea\\nLensLightRetina\\nHorizontal line out of focus\\nAstigmatism corrected by lensLight\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses.\\nThe lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sec-tions of the cornea that are causing the difficulty.

Gener-ally, if visual acuity is good and the patient experiencesno overt symptoms, treatment is not necessary. Whentreating larger amounts of astigmatism, or astigmatismfor the first time, the doctor may not totally correct theastigmatism. The cylindrical correction in the eyeglassesmay make the floor appear to tilt, thus making it difficultfor the patient at first. Generally, the doctor will placelenses in a trial frame to allow the patient to try the pre-scription at the exam. It may take a week or so to getused to the glasses, however, if the patient is having aproblem they should contact their doctor, who mightwant to recheck the prescription.\\nContact lenses that are used to correct astigmatism\\nare called toric lenses. When a person blinks, the contactlens rotates. In toric lenses, it is important for the lens toreturn to the same position each time. Lenses have thinzones, or cut-off areas (truncated), or have other ways torotate and return to the correct position. Soft toric lensesare available in a variety of prescriptions, materials, andeven in tints. Patients should ask their doctors about thepossibility of toric lenses.\\nIn 1997, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\napproved laser treatment of astigmatism. Patients consid-ering this should make sure the surgeon has a lot of expe-rience in the procedure and discuss the possible sideeffects or risks with the doctor. In the case of kerato-conus, a corneal transplant is performed if the astigma-tism can not be corrected with hard contact lenses.\\nPrognosis\\nAstigmatism is a condition that may be present at\\nbirth.

This is done through massage, alteration of theenvironment, and fitness training.\\nDescription\\nSeeking to solve movement problems, Aston-Pat-\\nterning helps make the most of their own unique bodytypes rather than trying to force them to conform to anideal. Unlike Rolfing , it doesn’t strive for linear symme-\\ntry. Rather it works with asymmetry in the human bodyto develop patterns of alignment and movement that feelright to the individual. Aston also introduced the idea ofworking in a three-dimensional spinal pattern.\\nAston-Patterning sessions have four general compo-\\nnents.

A-T also affects the immune system and increases therisk of leukemia and lymphoma in affected individuals.\\nDescription\\nThe disorder first appeared in the medical literature in\\nthe mid-1920s, but was not named specifically until 1957.The name is a combination of two recognized abnormali-ties: ataxia (lack of muscle control) and telangiectasia(abnormal dilatation of capillary vessels that often result intumors and red skin lesions ). However, A-T involves more\\nthan just the sum of these two findings. Other associatedA-T problems include immune system deficiencies,extreme sensitivity to radiation, and blood cancers.\\nMedical researchers initially suspected that multiple\\ngenes (the units responsible for inherited features) wereinvolved. However, in 1995, mutations in a single largegene were identified as causing A-T. Researchers namedthe gene ATM for A-T, mutated. Subsequent researchrevealed that ATM has a significant role in regulating celldivision. The symptoms associated with A-T reflect themain role of the AT gene, which is to induce several cellu-lar responses to DNA damage, such as preventing damagedDNA from being reproduced. When the AT gene is mutatedinto ATM, the signaling networks are affected and the cellno longer responds correctly to minimize the damage.\\nA-T is very rare, but it occurs in every population\\nworld wide, with an estimated frequency of between1/40,000 and 1/100,000 live births. But it is believed thatmany A-T cases, particularly those who die at a youngage, are never properly diagnosed. Therefore, this diseasemay actually be much more prevalent. According to theA-T Project Foundation, an estimated 1% (2.5 million inthe United States) of the general population carries defec-tive A-T genes. Carriers of one copy of this gene do notdevelop A-T, but have a significantly increased risk ofcancer . This makes the A-T gene one of the most impor-\\ntant cancer-related genes identified to date.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe ATM gene is autosomal recessive, meaning the\\ndisease occurs only if a defective gene is inherited fromboth parents. Infants with A-T initially often appear veryhealthy. At around age two, ataxia and nervous systemabnormalities becomes apparent. The root cause of A-T-associated ataxia is cell death in the brain, specifically\\nthe large branching cells of the nervous system (Purkin-je’s cells) which are located in the cerebellum. A toddlerbecomes clumsy, loses balance easily and lacks musclecontrol. Speech becomes slurred and more difficult, andthe symptoms progressively worsen. Between ages twoand eight, telangiectases, or tiny, red “spider” veins,\\nappear on the cheeks and ears and in the eyes.\\nBy age 10-12, children with A-T can no longer control\\ntheir muscles. Immune system deficiencies become com-mon, and affected individuals are extremely sensitive toradiation. Immune system deficiencies vary between indi-viduals but include lower-than-normal levels of proteinsthat function as antibodies (immunoglobulins) and whiteblood cells (blood cells not containing “iron” proteins). Thethymus gland, which aids in development of the body’simmune system, is either missing or has developed abnor-mally. Intelligence is normal, but growth may be retardedowing to immune system or hormonal deficiencies. Indi-viduals with A-T are also sometimes afflicted with dia-betes, prematurely graying hair, and difficulty swallowing.As the children grow older, the immune system becomesweaker and less capable of fighting infection. In the laterstages, recurrent respiratory infections and blood cancers,such as leukemia or lymphoma, are common.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis relies on recognizing the hallmarks of A-\\nT: progressive ataxia and telangiectasia. However, thismay be difficult as ataxia symptoms do appear prior totelangiectasia symptoms by several years. Other symp-toms can vary between individuals; for example, 70% ofindividuals with A-T have a high incidence of respiratoryinfection, 30% do not. The identification of the ATMgene raises hopes that screening, and perhaps treatment,may be possible.\\nTreatment\\nThere is currently no cure for A-T, and treatment\\nfocuses on managing the individual’s multiple symp-toms. Physical therapy and speech therapy can help thepatient adjust to ataxia. Injections of gamma globulin, orextracts of human blood that contain antibodies, are usedto strengthen the weakened immune system. High-dosevitamin administrations may also be prescribed.Research continues in many countries to find effectivetreatments. Individuals and families living with this dis-order may benefit from attending support groups.\\nPrognosis\\nA-T is a fatal condition. Children with A-T become\\nphysically disabled by their early teens and typically dieby their early 20s, usually from the associated blood can-cers and malignancies. In very rare cases, individualswith A-T may experience slower progression and aslightly longer life span, surviving into their 30s. A-Tcarriers have a five-fold higher risk than non-carriers ofdeveloping certain cancers, especially breast cancer .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 388Ataxia-telangiectasiaGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 388'),\n",

Alveoli are very thin-walled and contain a rich bloodsupply. They are important for lung function, since theirpurpose is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.When the airways are blocked by a mucous “plug,” for-eign object, or tumor, the alveoli are unable to fill withair and collapse of lung tissue can occur in the affectedarea. Atelectasis is a potential complication followingsurgery, especially in individuals who have undergonechest or abdominal operations resulting in associatedabdominal or chest pain during breathing. Congenital\\natelectasis can result from a failure of the lungs toexpand at birth. This congenital condition may be local-ized or may affect all of both lungs.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses of atelectasis include insufficient attemps at\\nrespiration by the newborn, bronchial obstruction, orabsence of surfactant (a substance secreted by alveolithat maintains the stability of lung tissue by reducing thesurface tension of fluids that coat the lung). This lack ofsurfactant reduces the surface area available for effectivegas exchange causing it to collapse if severe. Pressure onthe lung from fluid or air can cause atelectasis as well asobstruction of lung air passages by thick mucus resultingfrom various infections and lung diseases. Tumors andinhaled objects can also cause obstruction of the airway,\\nleading to atelectasis.\\nAnyone undergoing chest or abdominal surgery\\nusing general anesthesia is at risk to develop atelectasis,since breathing is often shallow after surgery to avoidpain from the surgical incision. Any significant decreasein airflow to the alveoli contributes to pooling of secre-tions, which in turn can cause infection. Chest injuriescausing shallow breathing, including fractured ribs, cancause atelectasis. Common symptoms of atelectasisinclude shortness of breath and decreased chest wall\\nexpansion. If atelectasis only afects a small area of thelung, symptoms are ususally minimal. If the conditionaffects a large area of the lung and develops quickly, theindividual may turn blue (cyanotic) or pale, have extremeshortness of breath, and feel a stabbing pain on theaffected side. Fever and increased heart rate may be pre-\\nsent if infection accompanies atelectasis.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo diagnose atelectasis, a doctor starts by recording\\nthe patient’s symptoms and performing a thorough phys-\\nical examination . When the doctor listens to the lungs\\nthrough a stethoscope (ausculation), diminished orbronchial breath sounds may be heard. By tapping on thechest (percussion) while listening through the stetho-scope, the doctor can often tell if the lung is collapsed. Achest x ray that shows an airless area in the lung con-\\nfirms the diagnosis of atelectasis. If an obstruction of theairways is suspected, a computed tomography scan (CT)or bronchoscopy may be performed to locate the cause\\nof the blockage.\\nTreatment\\nIf atelectasis is due to obstruction of the airway, the\\nfirst step in treatment is to remove the cause of the block-age. This may be done by coughing, suctioning, or bron-choscopy. If a tumor is the cause of atelectasis, surgerymay be necessary to remove it. Antibiotics are commonly\\nused to fight the infection that often accompanies atelec-tasis. In cases where recurrent or long-lasting infection isdisabling or where significant bleeding occurs, the affect-ed section of the lung may be surgically removed.\\nPrognosis\\nIf atelectasis is caused by a thick mucus “plug” or\\ninhaled foreign object, the patient usually recovers com-pletely when the blockage is removed. If it is caused by atumor, the outcome depends on the nature of the tumorinvolved. If atelectasis is a result of surgery, other post-oper-ative conditions and/or complications affect the prognosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 390Atelectasis\\nA computed tomography (CT) scan through a patient’s\\nchest.The collapsed lung appears at the right of the image.(Photo Researchers, Inc.

At the beginning of the procedure, medications tocontrol blood pressure, dilate the coronary arteries, andprevent blood clots are administered. The patient isawake but sedated. The catheter is inserted into an arteryin the groin, leg, or arm, and threaded through the bloodvessels into the blocked coronary artery. The cuttinghead is positioned against the plaque and activated, andthe plaque is ground up or suctioned out.The types of atherectomy are rotational, directional,\\nand transluminal extraction. Rotational atherectomy uses ahigh speed rotating shaver to grind up plaque. Directionalatherectomy was the first type approved, but is no longercommonly used; it scrapes plaque into an opening in oneside of the catheter. Transluminal extraction coronaryatherectomy uses a device that cuts plaque off vessel wallsand vacuums it into a bottle. It is used to clear bypass grafts.\\nPerformed in a cardiac catheterization lab, atherec-\\ntomy is also called removal of plaque from the coronaryarteries. It can be used instead of, or along with, balloonangioplasty. Atherectomy is successful about 95% of thetime.

In Greek, athere means gruel ,\\nand skleros means hard. Atherosclerosis is often called\\narteriosclerosis. Arteriosclerosis (from the Greek arteria,\\nmeaning artery ) is a general term for hardening of the\\narteries. Arteriosclerosis can occur in several forms,including atherosclerosis.\\nDescription\\nAtherosclerosis, a progressive process responsible\\nfor most heart disease, is a type of arteriosclerosis orhardening of the arteries. An artery is made up of severallayers: an inner lining called the endothelium, an elasticmembrane that allows the artery to expand and contract,a layer of smooth muscle, and a layer of connective tis-sue. Arteriosclerosis is a broad term that includes a hard-ening of the inner and middle layers of the artery. It canbe caused by normal aging , by high blood pressure, and\\nby diseases such as diabetes. Atherosclerosis is a type ofarteriosclerosis that affects only the inner lining of anartery. It is characterized by plaque deposits that blockthe flow of blood.\\nPlaque is made of fatty substances, cholesterol,\\nwaste products from the cells, calcium, and fibrin, astringy material that helps clot blood. The plaque forma-tion process stimulates the cells of the artery wall to pro-duce substances that accumulate in the inner layer. Fatbuilds up within these cells and around them, and theyform connective tissue and calcium. The inner layer ofthe artery wall thickens, the artery’s diameter is reduced,and blood flow and oxygen delivery are decreased.Plaques can rupture or crack open, causing the suddenformation of a blood clot (thrombosis).

It can cause astroke if it completely blocks the brain (carotid) arteries.\\nAtherosclerosis can also occur in the arteries of the neck,kidneys, thighs, and arms, causing kidney failure or gan-\\ngrene and amputation .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAtherosclerosis can begin in the late teens, but it\\nusually takes decades to cause symptoms. Some peopleexperience rapidly progressing atherosclerosis duringtheir thirties, others during their fifties or sixties. Athero-sclerosis is complex. Its exact cause is still unknown. It isthought that atherosclerosis is caused by a response todamage to the endothelium from high cholesterol , high\\nblood pressure, and cigarette smoking . A person who has\\nall three of these risk factors is eight times more likely todevelop atherosclerosis than is a person who has none.Physical inactivity, diabetes, and obesity are also risk\\nfactors for atherosclerosis. High levels of the amino acidhomocysteine and abnormal levels of protein-coated fatscalled lipoproteins also raise the risk of coronary artery\\ndisease . These substances are the targets of much current\\nresearch. The role of triglycerides, another fat that circu-lates in the blood, in forming atherosclerotic plaques isunclear. High levels of triglycerides are often associatedwith diabetes, obesity, and low levels of high-densitylipoproteins (HDL cholesterol). The more HDL (“good”)cholesterol, in the blood, the less likely is coronary arterydisease. These risk factors are all modifiable. Non-modi-fiable risk factors are heredity, sex, and age.\\nRisk factors that can be changed:\\n• Cigarette/tobacco smoke—Smoking increases both the\\nchance of developing atherosclerosis and the chance ofdying from coronary heart disease. Second hand smokemay also increase risk.\\n• High blood cholesterol—Cholesterol, a soft, waxy sub-\\nstance, comes from foods such as meat, eggs, and otheranimal products and is produced in the liver. Age, sex,heredity, and diet affect cholesterol. Total blood choles-terol is considered high at levels above 240 mg/dL andborderline at 200-239 mg/dL. High-risk levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) begin at 130-159mg/dL.\\n• High triglycerides—Most fat in food and in the body\\ntakes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride lev-els above 400 mg/dL have been linked to coronaryartery disease in some people. Triglycerides, however,are not nearly as harmful as LDL cholesterol.• High blood pressure—Blood pressure of 140 over 90 or\\nhigher makes the heart work harder, and over time, bothweakens the heart and harms the arteries.\\n• Physical inactivity—Lack of exercise increases the risk\\nof atherosclerosis.\\n• Diabetes mellitus—The risk of developing atheroscle-\\nrosis is seriously increased for diabetics and can belowered by keeping diabetes under control. Most dia-betics die from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.\\n• Obesity—Excess weight increases the strain on the\\nheart and increases the risk of developing atherosclero-sis even if no other risk factors are present.\\nRisk factors that cannot be changed:\\n• Heredity—People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are atincreased risk. The high rate of severe hypertension\\namong African-Americans puts them at increased risk.\\n• Sex—Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart\\nattacks than women are. After age 60, the risk is equalamong men and women.\\n• Age—Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and\\nolder and women who are 55 years of age and older.\\nSymptoms differ depending upon the location of the\\natherosclerosis.\\n• In the coronary (heart) arteries: Chest pain, heart attack,\\nor sudden death .\\n• In the carotid (brain) arteries: Sudden dizziness , weak-\\nness, loss of speech, or blindness.\\n• In the femoral (leg) arteries: Disease of the blood ves-\\nsels in the outer parts of the body ( peripheral vascular\\ndisease ) causes cramping and fatigue in the calves\\nwhen walking.\\n• In the renal (kidney) arteries: High blood pressure that\\nis difficult to treat.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians may be able to make a diagnosis of athero-\\nsclerosis during a physical exam by means of a stetho-scope and gentle probing of the arteries with the hand (pal-pation). More definite tests are electrocardiography ,\\nechocardiography or ultrasonography of the arteries (for\\nexample, the carotids), radionuclide scans, and angiogra-\\nphy.\\nAn electrocardiogram shows the heart’s activity. Elec-\\ntrodes covered with conducting jelly are placed on thepatient’s body. They send impulses of the heart to arecorder. The test takes about 10 minutes and is performedin a physician’s office.

Adevice that uses gamma rays to produce an image of theradioactive material (gamma camera) records pictures ofthe heart. Radionuclide angiography is usually performedin a hospital’s nuclear medicine department and takes 30-60 minutes. Thallium scanning is usually done after anexercise stress test or after injection of a vasodilator, a\\ndrug to enlarge the blood vessels, like dipyridamole (Per-santine).

A cardiologist inserts acatheter equipped with a viewing device into a blood ves-sel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart. Thepatient has been given a contrast dye that makes the heartvisible to x rays. Motion pictures are taken of the con-trast dye flowing though the arteries. Plaques and block-ages, if present, are well defined. The patient is awakebut has been given a sedative. Coronary angiography isperformed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory and\\ntakes from 30 minutes to two hours.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment includes lifestyle changes, lipid-lowering\\ndrugs, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ,\\nand coronary artery bypass surgery. Atherosclerosisrequires lifelong care.\\nPatients who have less severe atherosclerosis may\\nachieve adequate control through lifestyle changes anddrug therapy. Many of the lifestyle changes that preventdisease progression—a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, los-ing weight (if necessary), exercise, controlling bloodpressure, and not smoking—also help prevent the disease.\\nMost of the drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis seek\\nto lower cholesterol. Many popular lipid-lowering drugscan reduce LDL-cholesterol by an average of 25-30%when combined with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet.Lipid-lowering drugs include bile acid resins, “statins”(drugs that effect HMG-CoA reductase, an enzyme thatcontrols the processing of cholesterol), niacin, and fibricacid derivatives such as gemfibrozil (Lobid). Aspirin\\nhelps prevent thrombosis and a variety of other medica-tions can be used to treat the effects of atherosclerosis.\\nPercutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and\\nbypass surgery are invasive procedures that improveblood flow in the coronary arteries. Percutaneous translu-minal coronary angioplasty (coronary angioplasty) is anon-surgical procedure in which a catheter tipped with aballoon is threaded from a blood vessel in the thigh intothe blocked artery. The balloon is inflated, compresses theplaque to enlarge the blood vessel, and opens the blockedartery. Coronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiolo-gist in a hospital and generally requires a hospital stay ofone or two days. It is successful about 90% of the time,but for one-third of patients the artery narrows again with-in six months. It can be repeated and a “stent” may beplaced in the artery to help keep it open (see below).\\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery (bypass surgery),\\na detour is built around the blockage with a healthy veinor artery, which then supplies oxygen-rich blood to theheart. It is major surgery appropriate for patients with\\nblockages in two or three major coronary arteries orseverely narrowed left main coronary arteries, and forthose who have not responded to other treatments. It isperformed in a hospital under general anesthesia anduses a heart-lung machine. About 70% of patients experi-ence full relief; about 20% partial relief.\\nThree other semi-experimental surgical procedures\\nmay be used to treat atherosclerosis. In atherectomy ,a\\ncardiologist shaves off and removes strips of plaque fromthe blocked artery. In laser angioplasty, a catheter with alaser tip is inserted to burn or break down the plaque. Ametal coil called a stent may be permanently implantedto keep a blocked artery open.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies that focus on diet and lifestyle\\ncan help prevent, retard, or reverse atherosclerosis. Herbaltherapies that may be helpful include: hawthorn ( Cratae-\\ngus laevigata ), notoginseng root ( Panax notoginseng ),\\ngarlic ( Allium sativum ), ginger ( Zingiber officinale ), hot\\nred or chili peppers, yarrow ( Achillea millefolium ), and\\nalfalfa ( Medicago sativum ). Relaxation techniques\\nincluding yoga ,meditation ,guided imagery ,biofeed-\\nback , and counseling and other “talking” therapies may\\nalso be useful to prevent or slow the progress of the dis-ease. Dietary modifications focus on eating foods that arelow in fats (especially saturated fats), cholesterol, sugar,and animal proteins and high in fiber and antioxidants(found in fresh fruits and vegetables). Liberal use ofonions and garlic is recommended, as is eating raw andcooked fish, especially cold-water fish like salmon.Smoking, alcohol, and stimulants like coffee should beavoided. Chelation therapy , which uses anticoagulant\\ndrugs and nutrients to dissolve plaque and flush it throughthe kidneys, is controversial. Long-term remedies can beprescribed by specialists in ayurvedic medicine , which\\ncombines diet, herbal remedies, relaxation and exercise,and homeopathy , which treats a disease with small doses\\nof a drug that causes the symptoms of the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nAtherosclerosis can be successfully treated but not\\ncured. Recent clinical studies have shown that athero-sclerosis can be delayed, stopped, and even reversed byaggressively lowering LDL cholesterol. New diagnostictechniques enable physicians to identify and treat athero-sclerosis in its earliest stages. New technologies and sur-gical procedures have extended the lives of many patientswho would otherwise have died.

It includes a variety offoods that are low in fat and cholesterol and high infiber; plenty of fruits and vegetables; and limited sodi-um. Fat should comprise no more than 30%, and saturat-ed fat no more than 8-10%, of total daily caloriesaccording to the American Heart Association. Choles-terol should be limited to about 300 milligrams per dayand sodium to about 2,400 milligrams. The “FoodGuide” Pyramid developed by the U.S. Departments ofAgriculture and Health and Human Services providesdaily guidelines: 6-11 servings of bread, cereal, rice, andpasta; 3-5 servings of vegetables; 2-4 servings of fruit;2-3 servings of milk, yogurt, and cheese; and 2-3 serv-ings of meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.Fats, oils, and sweets should be used sparingly. Mono-unsaturated oils, like olive and rapeseed (Canola) aregood alternatives to use for cooking.\\n• Exercise regularly—Aerobic exercise can lower blood\\npressure, help control weight, and increase HDL(“good”) cholesterol. It may keep the blood vesselsmore flexible. Moderate to intense aerobic exerciselasting about 30 minutes (or three 10-minute exerciseperiods) four or more times per week is recommended,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-vention and the American College of Sports Medicine.Aerobic exercise includes walking, jogging, andcycling, active gardening, climbing stairs, or briskhousework.

Athlete’s foot (also known as tinea pedis orfoot ringworm ) can be treated, but it can be tenacious\\nand difficult to clear up completely.\\nDescription\\nAthlete’s foot is a very common condition of itchy,\\npeeling skin on the feet. In fact, it’s so common that mostpeople will have at least one episode at least once in theirlives. It’s less often found in women and children underage 12. (Symptoms that look like athlete’s foot in youngchildren most probably are caused by some other skincondition).\\nBecause the fungi grow well in warm, damp areas,\\nthey flourish in and around swimming pools, showers,and locker rooms. Tinea pedis got its common namebecause the infection was common among athletes whooften used these areas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAthlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that\\nmost often affects the fourth and fifth toe webs. Trichophy-\\nton rubrum ,T. mentagrophytes , and Epidermophyton floc-\\ncosum , the fungi that cause athlete’s foot, are unusual in\\nthat they live exclusively on dead body tissue (hair, theouter layer of skin, and nails). The fungus grows best inmoist, damp, dark places with poor ventilation. The prob-lem doesn’t occur among people who usually go barefoot.\\nMany people carry the fungus on their skin. Howev-\\ner, it will only flourish to the point of causing athlete’sfoot if conditions are right. Many people believe athlete’sfoot is highly contagious, especially in public swimmingpools and shower rooms. Research has shown, however,that it is difficult to pick up the infection simply by walk-ing barefoot over a contaminated damp floor. Exactlywhy some people develop the condition and others don’tis not well understood.\\nSweaty feet, tight shoes, synthetic socks that don’t\\nabsorb moisture well, a warm climate, and not drying thefeet well after swimming or bathing, all contribute to theovergrowth of the fungus.\\nSymptoms of athlete’s foot include itchy, sore skin\\non the toes, with scaling, cracking, inflammation, andblisters. Blisters that break, exposing raw patches of tis-sue, can cause pain and swelling. As the infection\\nspreads, itching and burning may get worse.\\nIf it’s not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the\\nsoles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infectionsmay appear at the same time, with crumbling, scaling andthickened nails, and nail loss.

This treatment dissolves certain substances inthe tissue sample, making it possible to see the fungiunder the microscope.\\nTreatment\\nAthlete’s foot may be resistant to medication and\\nshould not be ignored. Simple cases usually respond wellto antifungal creams or sprays (clotrimazole, ketocona-zole, miconazole nitrate, sulconazole nitrate, or tolnaf-tate). If the infection is resistant to topical treatment, thedoctor may prescribe an oral antifungal drug.\\nUntreated athlete’s foot may lead to a secondary\\nbacterial infection in the skin cracks.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA footbath containing cinnamon has been shown to\\nslow down the growth of certain molds and fungi, and issaid to be very effective in clearing up athlete’s foot. Tomake the bath:• heat four cups of water to a boil\\n• add eight to 10 broken cinnamon sticks\\n• reduce heat and simmer five minutes\\n• remove and let the mixture steep for 45 minutes until\\nlukewarm\\n• soak feet\\nOther herbal remedies used externally to treat ath-\\nlete’s foot include: a foot soak or powder containinggoldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ); tea tree oil ( Melaleu-\\ncaspp.); or calendula ( Calendula officinalis ) cream to\\nhelp heal cracked skin.\\nPrognosis\\nAthlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment,\\nbut it is important to take all medication as directed by adermatologist, even if the skin appears to be free of fun-gus. Otherwise, the infection could return. The toenailinfections that may accompany athlete’s foot, however,are typically very hard to treat effectively\\nPrevention\\nGood personal hygiene and a few simple precautions\\ncan help prevent athlete’s foot. To prevent spread of ath-lete’s foot:\\n• wash feet daily\\n• dry feet thoroughly (especially between toes)• avoid tight shoes (especially in summer)• wear sandals during warm weather\\n• wear cotton socks and change them often if they get\\ndamp\\n• don’t wear socks made of synthetic material• go barefoot outdoors when possible\\n• wear bathing shoes in public bathing or showering\\nareas\\n• use a good quality foot powder• don’t wear sneakers without socks• wash towels, contaminated floors, and shower stalls\\nwell with hot soapy water if anyone in the family hasathlete’s foot\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDonahue, Peggy Jo.

Turkington\\nAthletic heart syndrome\\nDefinition\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the adaptation of an ath-\\nlete’s heart in response the physiologic stresses of strenu-ous physical training. It can be difficult to distinguish asignificant medical condition from an athletic heart.\\nDescription\\nThe heart adapts to physical demands by enlarging,\\nespecially the left ventricle. Enlargement increases thecardiac output, the amount of blood pumped with eachbeat of the heart. The exact type of adaptation dependson the nature of the physical demand. There are twotypes of demand, static and dynamic. Static demandinvolves smaller groups of muscles under extreme resis-tance for brief period. An example is weight lifting.Dynamic training involves larger groups of muscles atlower resistance for extended periods of time. Examplesare aerobic training and tennis. Cardiac enlargement isassociated with dynamic training. The heart’s response tostatic training is hypertrophy, thickening of the musclewalls of the heart. As the wall of the heart adapts, thereare changes in the electrical conducting system of theheart. Because of the larger volume of blood beingpumped with each heart beat, the heart rate when at restdecreases below the normal level for nonathletes.\\nSudden unexpected death (SUD) is the death of an\\nathlete, usually during or shortly after physical activity.Often, there is no warning that the person will experienceSUD, although in some cases, warning signs appearwhich cause the person to seek medical advice. Impor-tantly, cases of death occurring during physical activityare not caused by athletic heart syndrome, but by undiag-nosed heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAthletic heart syndrome is the consequence of a nor-\\nmal adaptation by the heart to increased physical activity.The changes in the electrical conduction system of theheart may be pronounced and diagnostic, but should notcause problems. In the case of SUD, other heart prob-lems are involved. In 85-97% of the cases of SUD, anunderlying structural defect of the heart has been noted.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe changes in the heart beat caused by the electri-\\ncal conduction system of the heart are detectable on anelectrocardiogram. Many of the changes seen in athleticheart syndrome mimic those of various heart diseases.Careful examination must be made to distinguish heartdisease from athletic heart syndrome.\\nPrognosis\\nThe yearly rate for occurrence of SUD in people less\\nthan 35 years of age is less than seven incidents per100,000. Of all SUD cases, only about 8% are exercise\\nrelated. On a national basis, this means that each yearapproximately 25 athletes experience SUD. In personsover age 35, the incidence of SUD is approximately 55 in100,000, with only 3% of the cases occurring duringexercise.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAlexander, R. W., R. C. Schlant, and V .

Drastically reducing the amount of car-bohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen loss,which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect. Long-term weight loss occurs because with a low amount ofcarbohydrate intake, the body burns stored fat for energy.\\nThe four-step diet starts with a two-week induction\\nprogram designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo-lism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowedbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams perday. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry, fish,eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of carbohy-drates allowed equals about three cups of salad vegeta-bles, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery.\\nThe second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It\\nallows 15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When theindividual is about 10 pounds from their desired weight,\\nthey begin the pre-maintenance phase. This graduallyadds one to three servings a week of high carbohydratefoods, such as a piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheatbread. When the desired weight is reached, the mainte-nance stage begins. It allows 40-60 grams of carbohy-drates per day.\\nOpinion from the general medical community\\nremains mixed on the Atkins diet, but is generally unfa-vorable. There have been no significant long-term scien-tific studies on the diet. A number of leading medical andhealth organizations, including the American MedicalAssociation, American Dietetic Association (ADA), andthe American Heart Association oppose it. It is drastical-ly different than the dietary intakes recommended by theU.S. Department of Agriculture and the National Insti-tutes of Health. Much of the opposition is because thediet is lacking in some vitamins and nutrients, and\\nbecause it is high in fat. In a hearing before the U.S. Con-gress on February 24, 2000, an ADA representativecalled the Atkins diet “hazardous” and said it lacked sci-entific credibility.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 401Atkins diet\\nDR. ROBERT C. ATKINS (1930– )\\nDr. Robert C. Atkins graduated from the University\\nof Michigan in 1951 and received his medical degreefrom Cornell University Medical School in 1955 with aspecialty in cardiology. As an internist and cardiologist\\nhe developed the Atkins Diet in the early 1970s. The dietis a ketogenic diet—a high protein, high fat, and verylow carbohydrate regimen resulting in ketosis. It empha-sizes meat, cheese, and eggs, while discouraging foodssuch as bread, pasta, fruit, and sugar. It first came to pub-lic attention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’\\nDiet Revolution . The book quickly became a bestseller\\nbut unlike most other fad diet books, this one hasremained popular. At last count, it had been reprinted 28times and sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.Since then, Atkins has authored a number of other bookson his diet theme, including Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revo-\\nlution (1992), Dr. Atkins’ Quick and Easy New Diet\\nCookbook (1997), and The Vita-Nutrient Solution:\\nNature’s Answer to Drugs (1998).\\nAtkins has seen about 60,000 patients in his more\\nthan 30 years of practice. He has also appeared on numer-ous radio and television talk shows, has his own syndicat-ed radio program, Your Health Choices , and authors the\\nmonthly newsletter Dr. Atkins’ Health Revelations . Atkins\\nhas received the World Organization of Alternative Medi-cine’s Recognition of Achievement Award and beennamed the National Health Federation’s Man of the Year.He is director of the Atkins Center for ComplementaryMedicine which he founded in the early 1980s. The centeris located at 152 E. 55th St., New York, NY 10022.\\n(AP/Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 401'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 415}, page_content='Preparations\\nNo advance preparation is needed to go on the diet.\\nHowever, as with most diets , it is generally considered\\nappropriate to consult with a physician and to have aphysical evaluation before starting such a nutritional reg-imen. The evaluation should include blood tests to deter-mine levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin,and uric acid. A glucose tolerance test is also recom-mended.\\nPrecautions\\nAdherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-mends a wide-range of nutritional supplements, includ-ing a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,Atkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600micrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400 mil-ligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium, and450-675 mcg of biotin.\\nThe diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari-\\nans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro-tein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannotfollow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy-drates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends veg-etarians with a serious weight problem give up vegetari-\\nanism , or at least include fish in their diet.\\nSide effects\\nAccording to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse side\\neffects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a factsheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site(http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti-cian and author, said the diet may have serious sideeffects for some people. She said complications associat-ed with the diet include ketosis, dehydration , electrolyte\\nloss, calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidneyproblems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu-als with medical problems such as heart disease, hyper-\\ntension , kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over-\\nweight people with no health problems,” she said.\\nPeople with diabetes taking insulin are at risk of\\nbecoming hypoglycemic if they do not eat appropriatecarbohydrates. Also, persons who exercise regularly may\\nexperience low energy levels and muscle fatigue fromlow carbohydrate intake.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAtkins, Dr. Robert C. Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolution.

Although atopic dermatitis can appear at any\\nage, it is most common in children and young adults.Symptoms usually abate before the age of 25 and do notaffect the patient’s general health.\\nAbout one in ten babies develop a form of atopic\\ndermatitis called infantile eczema. Characterized by skinthat oozes and becomes encrusted, infantile eczema mostoften occurs on the face and scalp. The condition usuallyimproves before the child’s second birthday, and medicalattention can keep symptoms in check until that time.\\nWhen atopic dermatitis develops after infancy,\\ninflammation, blistering, oozing, and crusting are lesspronounced. The patient’s sores become dry, turn fromred to brownish-gray, and skin may thicken and becomescaly. In dark-skinned individuals, this condition cancause the complexion to lighten or darken. Itching asso-ciated with this condition is usually worst at night. It canbe so intense that patients scratch until their sores bleed,sometimes causing scarring and infection.\\nAtopic dermatitis affects about 3% of the population\\nof the United States, and about 80% of the people whohave the condition have one or more relatives with thesame condition or a similar one. Symptoms tend to bemost severe in females. Atopic dermatitis can erupt onany part of the skin, and crusted, thickened patches onthe fingers, palms, or the soles of the feet can last foryears. In teenagers and young adults, atopic dermatitisoften appears on one or more of the following areas:\\n• elbow creases\\n• backs of the knees• ankles\\n• wrists\\n• face• neck• upper chest• palms and between the fingers\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile allergic reactions often trigger atopic dermati-\\ntis, the condition is thought to be the result of an inherit-ed over-active immune system or a genetic defect thatcauses the skin to lose abnormally large amounts ofmoisture. The condition can be aggravated by a cycle thatdevelops in which the skin itches, the patient scratches,the condition worsens, the itching worsens, the patientscratches, etc. This cycle must be broken by relieving theitching to allow the skin time to heal.

Expo-\\nsure to any of the following can cause a flare-up:\\n• hot or cold temperatures\\n• wool and synthetic fabrics• detergents, fabric softeners, and chemicals• use of drugs that suppress immune-system activity\\nCertain foods, such as peanuts, cow’s milk, eggs,\\nand fish, can trigger symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Asmall percentage of patients with atopic dermatitis findthat their symptoms worsen after having been exposed todust, feather pillows, rough-textured fabrics, or othermaterials to which dust adheres.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of atopic dermatitis is usually based on\\nthe patient’s symptoms and personal and family healthhistory. Skin tests do not generally provide reliable infor-mation about this condition.\\nTreatment\\nAtopic dermatitis cannot be cured, but the severity\\nand duration of symptoms can be controlled. A dermatol-ogist should be consulted when symptoms first appear,and is likely to recommend warm baths to loosenencrusted skin, followed by applications of petroleumjelly or vegetable shortening to prevent the skin’s naturalmoisture from escaping.\\nExternally applied (topical) steroids or preparations\\ncontaining coal tar can relieve minor itching, but coal tarhas an unpleasant odor, stains clothes, and may increaseskin-cancer risk. Excessive use of steroid creams inyoung children can alter growth. Pregnant women shouldnot use products that contain coal tar. Topical steroids cancause itching, burning, acne , permanent stretch marks,\\nand thinning and spotting of the skin. Applying topicalsteroids to the area around the eyes can cause glaucoma .\\nOral antihistamines , such as diphenhydramine\\n(Benadryl), can relieve symptoms of allergy-related atopicdermatitis. More concentrated topical steroids are recom-mended for persistent symptoms. A mild tranquilizer maybe prescribed to reduce stress and help the patient sleep,and antibiotics are used to treat secondary infections.\\nCortisone ointments should be used sparingly, and\\nstrong preparations should never be applied to the face,groin, armpits, or rectal area. Regular medical monitor-ing is recommended for patients who use cortisonesalves or lotions to control wide-spread symptoms. Oralcortisone may be prescribed if the patient does notrespond to other treatments, but patients who take themedication for more than two weeks have a greater-than-average risk of developing severe symptoms when thetreatment is discontinued.\\nAllergy shots rarely improve atopic dermatitis and\\nsometimes aggravate the symptoms.

Atrial ectopic beats are also known as prema-ture atrial beats, premature atrial complex (PAC), or atri-al extrasystole.\\nDescription\\nAn AEB is usually a harmless disturbance in the\\nnormal rhythm of the heart. It can occur only occasional-ly, in a regular pattern, or several may occur in sequenceand then disappear. Most often, the person is unaware ofthe event.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAs people age, extra beats tend to happen more fre-\\nquently even in perfectly healthy individuals. AEB maybe triggered or increased by stress ,caffeine ,smoking ,\\nand some medicines. Cold remedies containing ephedrineor pseudoephedrine have been known to increase the inci-dence of atrial ectopic beats. AEB may also be the resultof an enlarged atria, lung disease, or the result of reducedblood supply to that area of the heart.If a person is aware of the event, the first symptom\\nof AEB is usually a feeling that the heart has skipped ormissed a beat. This is often accompanied by a feelingthat the heart is thumping or pounding in the chest. Thethumping or pounding is caused by the fact that whenthere is an AEB, the pause before the next beat is usuallylonger than normal. The next beat must be stronger thanusual to pump the accumulated blood out of the chamber.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AEB is often suspected on the basis of\\nthe patient’s description of the occurrence. An electrocar-diogram (ECG) can confirm the diagnosis. An ECGshows the heart beat as three wave forms. The first waveis called P, the second is called QRS, and the last is T. Anatrial ectopic beat will show up on the ECG as a P wavethat occurs closer than usual to the preceding T wave.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial ectopic beats do not usually require treatment.\\nIf treatment is necessary because the beats occur fre-quently and cause intolerable discomfort, the doctor mayprescribe medication.\\nPrognosis\\nOccasional AEB usually have no significance. If\\nthey increase in frequency, they can lead to atrial tachy-cardia or fibrillation and to a decrease in cardiac output.\\nPrevention\\nAEB cannot usually be prevented. Aggravating fac-\\ntors can be addressed, like excessive stimulants, anduncontrolled pulmonary disorders.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMcGoon, Michael D., ed.

In atrial fibrillation, the atria “quiver” chaotical-ly and the ventricles beat irregularly. In atrial flutter, theatria beat regularly and faster than the ventricles.\\nDescription\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are two types of cardiac\\narrhythmias , irregularities in the heart’s rhythm. Nearly\\n2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, according tothe American Heart Association. It is the most commonchronic arrhythmia. Atrial flutter is less common, butboth of these arrhythmias can cause a blood clot to formin the heart. This can lead to a stroke or a blockage car-\\nried by the blood flow (an embolism ) anywhere in the\\nbody’s arteries. Atrial fibrillation is responsible for about15% of strokes.\\nThe atria are the heart’s two small upper chambers. In\\natrial fibrillation, the heart beat is completely irregular.The atrial muscles contract very quickly and irregularly;the ventricles, the heart’s two large lower chambers, beatirregularly but not as fast as the atria. When the atria fibril-late, blood that is not completely pumped out can pool andform a clot. In atrial flutter, the heart beat is usually veryfast but steady. The atria beat faster than the ventricles.\\nAtrial fibrillation often occurs in people with various\\ntypes of heart disease. Atrial fibrillation may also resultfrom an inflammation of the heart’s covering ( pericardi-\\ntis), chest trauma or surgery, pulmonary disease, and cer-\\ntain medications. Atrial fibrillation is more common inolder people; about 10% of people over the age of 75have it. Atrial flutter and fibrillation usually occur in peo-ple with hypertensive or coronary heart disease and othertypes of heart disorders.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIn most cases, the cause of atrial fibrillation and flut-\\nter can be found, but often it cannot. Causes of theseheart beat abnormalities include:\\n• many types of heart disease\\n•stress and anxiety\\n•caffeine\\n• alcohol• tobacco• diet pills• some prescription and over-the-counter medications\\n• open heart surgery\\nSymptoms, when present, include:\\n• a fluttering feeling in the chest\\n• a pulse that feels like the heart is skipping, racing, jump-\\ning, or is irregular\\n• low energy• a faint or dizzy feeling• pressure or discomfort in the chest\\n• shortness of breath\\n• anxiety.\\nDiagnosis\\nA doctor can sometimes hear these arrhythmias\\nusing an instrument (a stethoscope) to listen to thesounds within the chest. Atrial fibrillation and flutter areusually diagnosed through electrocardiography\\n(EKGs), an exercisestress test , a 24-hour Holter EKG\\nmonitor, or a telephone cardiac monitor. An EKG showsthe heart’s activity and may reveal a lack of oxygen(ischemia ). Electrodes covered with conducting jelly are\\nplaced on the patient’s chest, arms, and legs. The elec-trodes send impulses of the heart’s activity through amonitor (called an oscilloscope) to a recorder that tracesthe pattern of the impulses onto paper. The test takesabout 10 minutes and is performed in a doctor’s office.The exercise stress test measures how the heart and bloodvessels respond to work when the patient is exercising ona treadmill or a stationary bike. This test is performed ina doctor’s office within an exercise laboratory and takes15-30 minutes.\\nIn 24-hour EKG (Holter) monitoring, the patient\\nwears a small, portable tape recorder connected to diskson his/her chest that record the heart’s rhythm duringnormal activities. An EKG called transtelephonic moni-toring identifies arrhythmias that occur infrequently.Like Holter monitoring , transtelephonic monitoring\\ncontinues for days or weeks and enables patients to sendthe EKG via telephone to a monitoring station when anarrhythmia is felt, or to store the information in therecorder and transmit it later. Doctors can also use high-frequency sound waves ( echocardiography ) to deter-\\nmine the structure and function of the heart. This diag-nostic method is often helpful to evaluate for underlyingheart disease.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter are usually treated with\\nmedications and/or electrical shock ( cardioversion ).

Cardioversion, the elec-tric shock to the chest wall, is usually performed emer-gencies. This device briefly suspends the heart’s activityand allows it to return to a normal rhythm.\\nAblation destroys the heart tissue that causes the\\narrhythmia. The tissue can be destroyed by catheteriza-tion or surgery. Radiofrequency catheter ablation , per-\\nformed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, can\\ncure atrial flutter and control the heart rate in atrial fib-rillation. The patient is awake but sedated. A thin tubecalled a catheter is inserted into a vein and is threadedinto the heart. At the end of the catheter, a device mapsthe electrical pathways of the heart. A cardiologist, adoctor specializing in the heart, uses this map to identifythe pathway(s) causing the arrhythmia, and then elimi-nates it (them) with bursts of high-frequency radiowaves. Surgical ablation is performed in an operatingroom under general anesthesia. Computerized mappingtechniques are combined with a cold probe to destroyarrhythmia-causing tissue. Ablation is generally suc-cessful. When ablation is used for atrial fibrillation, it isusually followed by implantation of a pacemaker as wellas drug therapy.\\nA pacemaker is a battery-powered device about the\\nsize of a matchbox that is surgically implanted near thecollarbone to regulate the heart beat. Lead wires thread-ed to the right side of the heart supply electrical energyto pace the atria and ventricles. The implantable car-dioverter defibrillator is a treatment for serious arrhyth-mias. The battery-powered device senses an abnormalheart rhythm and automatically provides electricalshock(s). The shock(s) suspends heart activity and thenallows the heart to initiate a normal rhythm. Wire elec-trodes on the device are attached to the heart. Some ofthe electrodes are attached to the outside of the heartand some are attached to the inside of the heart throughveins. The newest implantable cardioverter defibrilla-tors can be implanted in the chest wall and do notrequire open chest surgery. These devices weigh lessthan 10 oz and generally last seven or eight years. Animplantable cardioverter defibrillator is usually usedwith drug therapy, but the amount medication isreduced. In maze surgery, often the last resort, surgeonscreate a maze of stitches (sutures) that help the heart’selectrical impulses travel effectively.\\nMost of the drugs used for treatment have poten-\\ntial side effects and should be carefully monitored bya doctor. The goal of treatment is to control the rateand rhythm of the heart and to prevent the formation\\nof blood clots. If the arrhythmia is caused by heartdisease, the heart disease will also be treated. TheAmerican Heart Association recommends aggressivetreatment.\\nA digitalis drug, most commonly digoxin, is usually\\nprescribed to control the heart rate. Digitalis drugs slow\\nthe heart’s electrical impulses, helping to restore the nor-mal rate and rhythm. These drugs also increase the abili-ty of the heart’s muscular layer to contract and pumpproperly. Beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers\\ncan also be used for this purpose. Beta-blockers slow thespeed of electrical impulses through the heart. Some cal-cium channel blockers dampen the heart’s response toerratic electrical impulses.\\nTo prevent blood clots, aspirin or warfarin\\n(Coumadin) is administered. Warfarin, however, haspotential bleeding side effects, especially in olderpatients. Amiodarone is fairly efffective for atrial flutter.This drug is often able to maintain the heart’s properrhythm and can also help control the heart rate when theflutter occurs.\\nPrognosis\\nPatients with atrial fibrillation and flutter can live a\\nnormal life for many years as long as the arrhythmia iscontrolled and serious blood clots are prevented.\\nPrevention\\nAtrial fibrillation and flutter can sometimes be pre-\\nvented when the cause can be identified and controlled.Depending on the cause, prevention could include:\\n• treating the underlying heart disease• reducing stress and anxiety\\n• reducing or stopping consumption of caffeine, alcohol,\\nor tobacco; and/or\\n• discontinuing diet pills or other medications (over-the-\\ncounter or prescription)\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCurrent Medical Diagnosis and Treatment, 1998. 37th ed.

Normally,this opening closes before birth, but if it does not, thechild is born with a hole between the left and right atria.This abnormal opening is called an atrial septal defectand causes blood from the left atrium to flow into theright atrium.\\nDifferent types of atrial septal defects can occur, and\\nthey are classified according to where in the separatingwall they are found. The most commonly found atrialseptal defect occurs in the middle of the atrial septumand accounts for about 70% of all atrial septal defects.Abnormal openings can form in the upper and lowerparts of the atrial septum as well.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAbnormal openings in the atrial septum occur dur-\\ning fetal development and are twice as common infemales as in males. These abnormalities can go unno-ticed if the opening is small, producing no abnormalsymptoms. If the defect is big, large amounts of bloodflowing from the left to the right atrium will cause theright atrium to swell to hold the extra blood.\\nPeople born with an atrial septal defect can have no\\nsymptoms through their twenties, but by age 40, mostpeople with this condition have symptoms that caninclude shortness of breath , rapid abnormal beating of\\nthe atria (atrial fibrillation), and eventually heart failure .\\nDiagnosis\\nAtrial septal defects can be identified by various\\nmethods. Abnormal changes in the sound of the heartbeats can be heard when a doctor listens to the heart witha stethoscope. In addition, a chest x ray , an electrocar-\\ndiogram (ECG, an electrical printout of the heartbeats),and an echocardiogram (a test that uses sound waves toform a detailed image of the heart) can also be used toidentify this condition.\\nAn atrial septal defect can also be diagnosed by using\\na test called cardiac catheterization .

If the heart has an openingbetween the atria, oxygen-rich blood from the left atriumenters the right atrium. Through cardiac catheterization,doctors can detect the higher-than-normal amount of oxy-gen in the heart’s right atrium, right ventricle, and thelarge blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs, wherethe blood would normally subsequently get its oxygen.\\nTreatment\\nAtrial septal defects often correct themselves without\\nmedical treatments by the age of two. If this dose not hap-pen, surgery is done by sewing the hole closed, or bysewing a patch of Dacron material or a piece of the sac thatsurrounds the heart (the pericardium), over the opening.\\nSome patients can have the defect fixed by having an\\nclam-shaped plug placed over the opening. This plug is aman-made device that is put in place through a catheterinserted into the heart.\\nPrognosis\\nIndividuals with small defects can live a normal life,\\nbut larger defects require surgical correction. Less than1% of people younger than 45 years of age die from cor-rective surgery. Five to ten percent of patients can diefrom the surgery if they are older than 40 and have otherheart-related problems.

Many symptoms, particularly hyperactivity,diminish in early adulthood, but impulsivity and inatten-tion problems remain with up to 50% of ADHD individu-als throughout their adult life.\\nChildren with ADHD have short attention spans,\\nbecoming easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks.Although they may be quite intelligent, their lack of focusfrequently results in poor grades and difficulties in school.ADHD children act impulsively, taking action first andthinking later.

Their clumsiness may\\nextend to the social arena, where they are sometimesshunned due to their impulsive and intrusive behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of ADHD are not known. However, it\\nappears that heredity plays a major role in the develop-ment of ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sib-ling are more likely to develop the disorder themselves.Before birth, ADHD children may have been exposed topoor maternal nutrition , viral infections, or maternal\\nsubstance abuse. In early childhood, exposure to lead orother toxins can cause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumaticbrain injury or neurological disorders may also triggerADHD symptoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD isnot known, an imbalance of certain neurotransmitters,the chemicals in the brain that transmit messagesbetween nerve cells, is believed to be the mechanismbehind ADHD symptoms.\\nA widely publicized study conducted by Dr. Ben\\nFeingold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to\\ncertain foods and food additives caused the characteristichyperactivity of ADHD children. Although some chil-dren may have adverse reactions to certain foods that canaffect their behavior (for example, a rash might tem-porarily cause a child to be distracted from other tasks),carefully controlled follow-up studies have uncovered nolink between food allergies and ADHD. Another popular-ly held misconception about food and ADHD is that theconsumption of sugar causes hyperactive behavior.Again, studies have shown no link between sugar intakeand ADHD. It is important to note, however, that a nutri-tionally balanced diet is important for normal develop-ment in allchildren.\\nPsychologists and other mental health professionals\\ntypically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta-\\ntistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition(DSM-IV) as a guideline for determining the presence of\\nADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD, DSM-IV requires the\\npresence of at least six of the following symptoms ofinattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivityand impulsivity combined:\\nInattention:\\n• fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless\\nmistakes in schoolwork or other activities\\n• has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities• does not appear to listen when spoken to• does not follow through on instructions and does not\\nfinish tasks\\n• has difficulty organizing tasks and activities• avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental\\neffort (e.g., homework)\\n• is easily distracted\\n• is forgetful in daily activities\\nHyperactivity:\\n• fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat• does not remain seated when expected to• runs or climbs excessively when inappropriate (in ado-\\nlescence and adults, feelings of restlessness)\\n• has difficulty playing quietly\\n• is constantly on the move\\n• talks excessively\\nImpulsivity:\\n• blurts out answers before the question has been com-\\npleted\\n• has difficulty waiting for his or her turn\\n• interrupts and/or intrudes on others\\nDSM-IV also requires that some symptoms develop\\nbefore age seven, and that they significantly impair func-tioning in two or more settings (e.g., home and school)for a period of at least six months. Children who meet thesymptom criteria for inattention, but not for hyperactivi-ty/impulsivity are diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, Predominantly Inattentive Type,commonly called ADD. (Young girls with ADHD maynot be diagnosed because they have mainly this subtypeof the disorder.)\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step in determining if a child has ADHD is\\nto consult with a pediatrician. The pediatrician can makean initial evaluation of the child’s developmental maturi-ty compared to other children in his or her age group.The physician should also perform a comprehensivephysical examination to rule out any organic causes of\\nADHD symptoms, such as an overactive thyroid orvision or hearing problems.\\nIf no organic problem can be found, a psychologist,\\npsychiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learningspecialist is typically consulted to perform a comprehen-sive ADHD assessment. A complete medical, family,social, psychiatric, and educational history is compiledfrom existing medical and school records and frominterviews with parents and teachers. Interviews mayalso be conducted with the child, depending on his orher age. Along with these interviews, several clinicalinventories may also be used, such as the Conners Rat-ing Scales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Ques-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 411Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)GEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 411'),\n",

These inven-tories provide valuable information on the child’s behav-ior in different settings and situations. In addition, theWender Utah Rating Scale has been adapted for use indiagnosing ADHD in adults.\\nIt is important to note that mental disorders such as\\ndepression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms\\nsimilar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psy-chiatric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHDfrom other possible mood and behavioral disorders.Bipolar disorder , for example, may be misdiagnosed, as\\nADHD.\\nPublic schools are required by federal law to offer\\nfree ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician can alsoprovide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialistfor ADHD assessment. Parents should check with theirinsurance plans to see if these services are covered.\\nTreatment\\nPsychosocial therapy, usually combined with med-\\nications, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviateADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam-phetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) are commonly prescribed to controlhyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase atten-tion span. They work by stimulating the production ofcertain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible sideeffects of stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heart-beat, loss of appetite, and insomnia . However, the med-\\nications are usually well-tolerated and safe in most cases.\\nIn children who don’t respond well to stimulant ther-\\napy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine (Nor-pramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are fre-quently recommended. Reported side effects of thesedrugs include persistent dry mouth ,sedation , disorien-\\ntation, and cardiac arrhythmia (particularly withdesipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHDtherapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres-sant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an SSRI antidepressant; andcarbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsantdrug. Clonidine (Catapres), an antihypertensive medica-tion, has also been used to control aggression and hyper-activity in some ADHD children, although it should not\\nbe used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medicationwill change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp-toms should be monitored closely and prescriptionsadjusted accordingly.\\nBehavior modification therapy uses a reward system\\nto reinforce good behavior and task completion and canbe implemented both in the classroom and at home. Atangible reward such as a sticker may be given to the childevery time he completes a task or behaves in an accept-able manner. A chart system may be used to display thestickers and visually illustrate the child’s progress. Whena certain number of stickers are collected, the child maytrade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zooor a day at the beach. The reward system stays in placeuntil the good behavior becomes ingrained.\\nA variation of this technique, cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy , works to decrease impulsive behavior by get-\\nting the child to recognize the connection betweenthoughts and behavior, and to change behavior by chang-ing negative thinking patterns.\\nIndividual psychotherapy can help an ADHD child\\nbuild self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their wor-ries and anxieties, and help them gain insight into theirbehavior and feelings. Family therapy may also be ben-\\neficial in helping family members develop coping skillsand in working through feelings of guilt or anger parentsmay be experiencing.\\nADHD children perform better within a familiar,\\nconsistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce-ments for good behavior and real consequences for bad.Family, friends, and caretakers should all be educated onthe special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child.Communication between parents and teachers is espe-cially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro-priate learning environment.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD.\\nAlthough there is a lack of controlled studies to provetheir efficacy, proponents report that they are successfulin controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients. Someof the more popular alternative treatments include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 412Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)Drugs Used To Treat ADHD\\nBrand Name (Generic Name) Possible Common Side Effects Include:\\nCylert (pemoline) Insomnia\\nDexedrine (dextroamphetamine sulfate) Excessive stimulation, restlessnessRitalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride) Insomnia, nervousness, loss of appetiteGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 412'),\n",

Based in part on the Feingold food\\nallergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritionalplan that is high in protein and complex carbohydratesand free of white sugar and salicylate-containing foodssuch as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.\\n• Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of natur-\\nal remedies to address the symptoms of ADHD, suchas ginkgo ( Gingko biloba ) for memory and mental\\nsharpness and chamomile ( Matricaria recutita ) extract\\nfor calming. The safety of herbal remedies has notbeen demonstrated in controlled studies. For example,it is known that gingko may affect blood coagulation,but controlled studies have not yet evaluated the risk ofthe effect.\\n• Homeopathic medicine. This is probably the most effec-\\ntive alternative therapy for ADD and ADHD because ittreats the whole person at a core level. Constitutionalhomeopathic care is most appropriate and requires con-sulting with a well-trained homeopath who has experi-ence working with ADD and ADHD individuals.\\nPrognosis\\nUntreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s social\\nand educational performance and can seriously damagehis or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children haveimpaired relationships with their peers, and may belooked upon as social outcasts. They may be perceived asslow learners or troublemakers in the classroom. Siblingsand even parents may develop resentful feelings towardsthe ADHD child.KEY TERMS\\nConduct disorder —A behavioral and emotional\\ndisorder of childhood and adolescence.

It is also used in the doctor’s office orhospital audiology department to diagnose hearing prob-lems in children, adults, and the elderly. With correct diag-nosis of a person’s specific pattern of hearing impairment,the right type of therapy, which might include hearing aids ,\\ncorrective surgery, or speech therapy, can be prescribed.\\nPrecautions\\nTesting with audiometry equipment is simple and\\npainless. No special precautions are required.\\nDescription\\nA trained audiologist (a specialist in detecting hear-\\ning loss) uses an audiometer to conduct audiometry test-ing. This equipment emits sounds or tones, like musicalnotes, at various frequencies, or pitches, and at differingvolumes or levels of loudness. Testing is usually done ina soundproof testing room.\\nThe person being tested wears a set of headphones\\nthat blocks out other distracting sounds and delivers atest tone to one ear at a time. At the sound of a tone, thepatient holds up a hand or finger to indicate that thesound is detected. The audiologist lowers the volume andrepeats the sound until the patient can no longer detect it.This process is repeated over a wide range of tones orfrequencies from very deep, low sounds, like the lowestnote played on a tuba, to very high sounds, like the ping-ing of a triangle. Each ear is tested separately. It is notunusual for levels of sensitivity to sound to differ fromone ear to the other.\\nA second type of audiometry testing uses a headband\\nrather than headphones. The headband is worn with smallplastic rectangles that fit behind the ears to conduct soundthrough the bones of the skull. The patient being testedsenses the tones that are transmitted as vibrations throughthe bones to the inner ear. As with the headphones, thetones are repeated at various frequencies and volumes.\\nThe results of the audiometry test may be recorded\\non a grid or graph called an audiogram. This graph isgenerally set up with low frequencies or tones at one endand high ones at the other end, much like a piano key-board. Low notes are graphed on the left and high noteson the right. The graph also charts the volume of thetones used; from soft, quiet sounds at the top of the chartto loud sounds at the bottom. Hearing is measured inunits called decibels. Most of the sounds associated withnormal speech patterns are generally spoken in the rangeof 20-50 decibels. An adult with normal hearing candetect tones between 0-20 decibels.\\nSpeech audiometry is another type of testing that\\nuses a series of simple recorded words spoken at variousvolumes into headphones worn by the patient being test-ed. The patient repeats each word back to the audiologistas it is heard. An adult with normal hearing will be ableto recognize and repeat 90-100% of the words.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 414Audiometry\\nAn audiologist conducting a hearing test.

Some of these disorders includeattention deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD), autism ,\\ndyslexia, and central auditory processing disorders(CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate cen-tral and cortical organization.\\nAuditory integration is one facet of what audiolo-\\ngists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin-ition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi-ty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, whichis: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditoryintegration is actually the perception of sound, includingthe ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining itin both the long- and short-term memory, to be able tolisten to sound selectively, and to localize it.\\nGuy Berard developed one of the programs com-\\nmonly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con-sists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi-cal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran-dom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listensthrough earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer-cise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done insessions twice a day for 10 days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 415Auditory integration trainingGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 415'),\n",

Thebasis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow:\\n• The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt sound\\nwaves into signals that charge the brain.\\n• Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can be\\nconsidered something that nourishes the nervous sys-tem, either stimulating or destimulating it.\\n• Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is not\\nthe same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening isactive.\\n• A person’s ability to listen affects all language develop-\\nment for that person. This process influences everyaspect of self-image and social development.\\n• The capacity to listen can be changed or improved\\nthrough auditory stimulation using musical and vocalsounds at high frequencies.ALFRED TOMATIS (1920– )\\n• Communication begins in the womb. As early as the\\nbeginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hearsounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner-vous system of the baby to develop.\\nDescription\\nA quartet of CAP defects have been identified that\\ncan unfavorably alter how each person processes sound.Among these are:\\n• Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when the\\nbrain incorrectly decodes what is being heard. Soundsare unrecognizable, often because the person speakingtalks too fast.\\n• Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little or\\npoor tolerance for background sounds.\\n• Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to put\\ntogether things heard with things seen. Characteristical-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 416Auditory integration training\\nInternationally renowned French otolaryngologist,\\npsychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis per-ceived the importance of sound and hearing early in hiscareer. He took his degree as a Doctor of Medicine fromthe University of Paris and specialized in ear, nose andthroat medicine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatisearly in his career treated some of his parents’ fellow\\nopera singers. From these experiences with the sound ofmusic, he developed the principle that has come to beknown as the Tomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice canonly sing what it hears.\\nTomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It was\\nhis research that made the world aware that the ears of aninfant in utero are already functioning at four and halfmonths of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides nour-ishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postulatedthat the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutrientheard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and stimu-lates the growth of the brain.\\nTomatis took this further, into the realm of language.\\nTomatis concluded that the need to communicate and tobe understood are among our most basic needs. He was apioneer in perceiving that language problems convert intosocial problems for people. “Language is what character-izes man and makes him different from other creatures,”Tomatis is quoted as saying. The techniques he developedto teach people how to listen effectively are international-ly respected tools used in the treatment of autism, atten-tion-deficit disorder, and other learning disabilities.\\nHis listening program, the invention of the Electronic\\nEar, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound andmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguablythe best known and most successful ear specialist in theworld. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centersworldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related tothe ability to hear.\\n(Photograph by V. Brynner. Gamma Liaison.

It is characterizedby disorganization in handling auditory and other infor-mation.\\nCertain audiological tests are carried out to see if the\\nperson has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is.Other tests give more specific information regarding thenature of the CAP problem. They include:\\n• Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea-\\nsures peripheral hearing loss. If loss is found, thenbone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibrationof small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.\\n• Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per-\\nson’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done bypresenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the per-son’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scoresequal the percentage of words heard correctly.\\n• Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessing\\nthe status of, and the protective mechanisms of the mid-dle ear.\\n• Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40\\ncompound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibelsabove threshold to each ear of the person being tested.This test provides expanded information that makes itpossible to break down CAP problems into the fourbasic types.\\n• Speech in noise discrimination (SN) testing is similar to\\nStaggered Sporadic Word testing except that other noiseis also added and the percentage correct in quiet is com-pared with that correct when there is added noise.\\n• Phonemic synthesis (PS) determines serious learning\\nproblems. The types of errors made in sounding outwritten words or associating written letters with thesounds they represent help in determining the type andseverity of CAP problems.\\nPurpose\\nUpon completion of an auditory integration training\\nprogram, the person’s hearing should be capable of per-ceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same level. Totalimprovement from this therapy, in both hearing andbehavior, can take up to one year.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nAuditory integration training is based upon newly\\nlearned information about the brain. Though brain struc-tures and connections are predetermined, probably byheredity, another factor called plasticity also comes into\\nplay. Learning, we now know, continues from birth todeath. Plasticity is the ability of the brain to actuallychange its structuring and connections through theprocess of learning.\\nProblems with auditory processing are now viewed\\nas having a wide–reaching ripple effect on our society. Itis estimated that 30–40% of children starting school havelanguage-learning skills that can be described as poor.CAP difficulties are a factor in several different learningdisabilities. They affect not only academic success, butalso nearly every aspect of societal difficulties. Oneexample to illustrate this is a 1989 University of Buffalostudy where CAP problems were found to be present in asurprising 97% of youth inmates in an upstate New Yorkcorrections facility.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nKatz, Jack, Ph.D., Wilma Laufer Gabbay, M.S., Deborah S.\\nUngerleider, M.A., and Lorin Wilde, M.S.

A person withautism must learn how to communicate normally andhow to relate to people, objects and events. However,not all patients suffer the same degree of impairment.There is a full spectrum of symptoms, which can rangefrom mild to severe.\\nAutism occurs in as many as one or two per 1,000\\nchildren. It is found four times more often in boys (usual-ly the first-born) and occurs around the world in all racesand social backgrounds. Autism usually is evident in thefirst three years of life, although in some children it’shard to tell when the problem develops. Sometimes thecondition isn’t diagnosed until the child enters school.\\nWhile a person with autism can have symptoms\\nranging from mild to severe, about 10% have an extraor-dinary ability in one area, such as in mathematics, mem-ory, music, or art. Such children are known as “autisticsavants” (formerly known as “idiot savants.”).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAutism is a brain disorder that affects the way the\\nbrain uses or transmits information. Studies have foundabnormalities in several parts of the brain that almostcertainly occurred during fetal development. The prob-lem may be centered in the parts of the brain responsiblefor processing language and information from the senses.\\nThere appears to be a strong genetic basis for\\nautism. Identical twins are more likely to both beaffected than twins who are fraternal (not geneticallyidentical). In a family with one autistic child, thechance of having another child with autism is about 1in 20, much higher than in the normal population.Sometimes, relatives of an autistic child have mildbehaviors that look very much like autism, such asrepetitive behaviors and social or communication prob-lems. Research also has found that some emotional dis-orders (such as manic depression) occur more often infamilies of a child with autism.\\nAt least one group of researchers has found a link\\nbetween an abnormal gene and autism. The gene may bejust one of at least three to five genes that interact insome way to cause the condition. Scientists suspect that afaulty gene or genes might make a person vulnerable todevelop autism in the presence of other factors, such as achemical imbalance, viruses or chemicals, or a lack of\\noxygen at birth.\\nIn a few cases, autistic behavior is caused by a dis-\\nease such as:\\n•rubella in the pregnant mother\\n• tuberous sclerosis\\n•fragile X syndrome\\n• encephalitis\\n• untreated phenylketonuria .\\nThe severity of the condition varies between individ-\\nuals, ranging from the most severe (extremely unusual,repetitive, self- injurious, and aggressive behavior) tovery mild, resembling a personality disorder with somelearning disability.\\nProfound problems with social interaction are the\\nmost common symptoms of autism. Infants with the dis-order won’t cuddle; they avoid eye contact and don’tseem to want or need physical contact or affection. Theymay become rigid or flaccid when they are held, cry whenpicked up, and show little interest in human contact. Sucha child doesn’t smile or lift his arms in anticipation ofbeing picked up. He forms no attachment to parents norshows any normal anxiety toward strangers. He doesn’t\\nlearn typical games of childhood, such as peek-a-boo.\\nLanguage problems\\nThe child with autism may not speak at all; if he\\ndoes, it is often in single words. He may endlessly repeatwords or phrases that are addressed to him and mayreverse pronouns (“You go sleep” instead of “I want togo to sleep”).\\nRestricted interests and activity\\nUsually a child with autism has many problems\\nplaying normally. He probably won’t act out adultrolesduring play time, and instead of enjoying fantasy play, hemay simply repeatedly mimic the actions of someoneelse. Bizarre behavior patterns are very common amongautistic children and may include complex rituals,screaming fits, rhythmic rocking, arm flapping, fingertwiddling, and crying without tears. Autistic childrenmay play with their own saliva, feces or urine.They maybe self-destructive, biting their own hands, gouging attheir eyes, pulling their hair, or banging their head.\\nSensory problems\\nThe sensory world poses a real problem to many\\nautistic children, who seem overwhelmed by their ownsenses.

Many ofthese children may react to sounds by banging their heador flapping fingers. Some high-functioning autistic adultswho have written books about their childhood experi-ences report that sounds were often excruciatinglypainful to them, forcing them to withdraw from theirenvironment or try to cope by withdrawing into their ownworld of sensation and movement.\\nIntellectual problems\\nMost autistic children appear to be moderately mental-\\nly retarded. They may giggle or cry for no reason, have nofear of real danger, but exhibit terror of harmless objects.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere is no medical test for autism. Because the\\nsymptoms of autism are so varied, the condition may goundiagnosed for some time (especially in those with mildcases or if other handicaps are also present). It may beconfused with other diseases, such as fragile X syndrome,tuberous sclerosis, and untreated phenylketonuria.Autism is diagnosed by observing the child’s behav-\\nior, communication skills, and social interactions. Med-ical tests should rule out other possible causes of autisticsymptoms. Criteria that mental health experts use todiagnose autism include:\\n• problems with developing friendships• problems with make-believe or social play\\n• endlessly repeated words or strings of words\\n• difficulty in carrying on a conversation• obsessions with rituals or restricted patterns• preoccupation with parts of objects\\nSome children have a few of the symptoms of autism,\\nbut not enough to be diagnosed with the “classical” formof the condition. Children who have autistic behavior butno problems with language may be diagnosed with“Asperger syndrome.” Children who seem normal at firstbut who begin to show autistic behavior as they get oldermight be diagnosed with “childhood disintegrative disor-der” (CDD). These problems are sometimes called “autis-tic spectrum disorders.” It is also important to rule outother problems that seem similar to autism.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 419Autism\\nThis autistic child is encouraged to interact with the guinea pig in an effort to improve his social interaction.

A general autoim-\\nmune disease in which antibodies attack a number ofdifferent tissues. The disease recurs periodically and isseen mainly in young and middle-aged women.\\n•Rheumatoid arthritis . Occurs when the immune sys-\\ntem attacks and destroys the tissues that line bone jointsand cartilage. The disease occurs throughout the body,although some joints may be more affected than others.\\n• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Occurs when antibodies are\\ndeposited in the membranes of both the lung and kid-neys, causing both inflammation of kidney glomerulus(glomerulonephritis ) and lung bleeding. It is typically\\na disease of young males.\\n• Grave’s disease. Caused by an antibody that binds to\\nspecific cells in the thyroid gland, causing them tomake excessive amounts of thyroid hormone.\\n• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis . Caused by an antibody that\\nbinds to cells in the thyroid gland. Unlike in Grave’sdisease, however, this antibody’s action results in lessthyroid hormone being made.\\n• Pemphigus vulgaris. A group of autoimmune disorders\\nthat affect the skin.\\n•Myasthenia gravis . A condition in which the immune\\nsystem attacks a receptor on the surface of muscle cells,preventing the muscle from receiving nerve impulsesand resulting in severe muscle weakness.\\n•Scleroderma . Also called CREST syndrome or pro-\\ngressive systemic sclerosis, scleroderma affects theconnective tissue.\\n• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia . Occurs when the\\nbody produces antibodies that coat red blood cells.• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Disorder in\\nwhich the immune system targets and destroys bloodplatelets.\\n•Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. Immune disorders\\nthat affect the neuromuscular system.\\n•Pernicious anemia . Disorder in which the immune\\nsystem attacks the lining of the stomach in such a waythat the body cannot metabolize vitamin B\\n12.\\n• Sjögren’s syndrome. Occurs when the exocrine glands\\nare attacked by the immune system, resulting in exces-sive dryness.\\n•Ankylosing spondylitis . Immune system induced\\ndegeneration of the joints and soft tissue of the spine.\\n•Vasculitis . A group of autoimmune disorders in which\\nthe immune system attacks and destroys blood vessels.\\n• Type I diabetes mellitus . May be caused by an anti-\\nbody that attacks and destroys the islet cells of the pan-creas, which produce insulin.\\n• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. Also called Lou\\nGehrig’s disease. An immune disorder that causes thedeath of neurons which leads to progressive loss of\\nmuscular control.\\n• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Also called infectious\\npolyneuritis. Often occurring after an infection or animmunization (specifically Swine flu), the diseaseaffects the myelin sheath, which coats nerve cells. Itcauses progressive muscle weakness and paralysis .\\n•Multiple sclerosis . An autoimmune disorder that may\\ninvolve a virus affects the central nervous system, caus-ing loss of coordination and muscle control.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nTo further understand autoimmune disorders, it is\\nhelpful to understand the workings of the immune sys-tem. The purpose of the immune system is to defend thebody against attack by infectious microbes (germs) andforeign objects . When the immune system attacks an\\ninvader, it is very specific—a particular immune systemcell will only recognize and target one type of invader.To function properly, the immune system must not onlydevelop this specialized knowledge of individualinvaders, but it must also learn how to recognize andnot destroy cells that belong to the body itself. Everycell carries protein markers on its surface that identifiesit in one of two ways: what kind of cell it is (e.g. nervecell, muscle cell, blood cell, etc.) and to whom that cellbelongs. These markers are called major histocompata-bility complexes (MHCs). When functioning properly,cells of the immune system will not attack any othercell with markers identifying it as belonging to the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 422Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 422'),\n",

Conversely, if the immune system cells do not\\nrecognize the cell as “self,” they attach themselves to itand put out a signal that the body has been invaded,which in turn stimulates the production of substancessuch as antibodies that engulf and destroy the foreignparticles. In case of autoimmune disorders, the immunesystem cannot distinguish between “self” cells andinvader cells. As a result, the same destructive operationis carried out on the body’s own cells that would nor-mally be carried out on bacteria, viruses, and other suchharmful entities.\\nThe reasons why immune systems become dys-\\nfunctional in this way is not well understood. However,most researchers agree that a combination of genetic,environmental, and hormonal factors play into autoim-munity. Researchers also speculate that certain mecha-nisms may trigger autoimmunity. First, a substance thatis normally restricted to one part of the body, and there-fore not usually exposed to the immune system, isreleased into other areas where it is attacked. Second,the immune system may mistake a component of thebody for a similar foreign component. Third, cells ofthe body may be altered in some way, either by drugs,infection, or some other environmental factor, so thatthey are no longer recognizable as “self” to the immunesystem. Fourth, the immune system itself may be dam-aged, such as by a genetic mutation, and therefore can-not function properly.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of the above disorders include:\\n• Systemic lupus erythematosus. Symptoms include\\nfever , chills, fatigue , weight loss, skin rashes (particu-\\nlarly the classic “butterfly” rash on the face), vasculitis,polyarthralgia, patchy hair loss, sores in the mouth ornose, lymph-node enlargement, gastric problems, and,in women, irregular periods. About half of those whosuffer from lupus develop cardiopulmonary problems,and some may also develop urinary problems. Lupuscan also effect the central nervous system, causingseizures, depression, and psychosis.\\n• Rheumatoid arthritis. Initially may be characterized by a\\nlow-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, and a gener-alized pain in the joints. The joint pain then becomes\\nmore specific, usually beginning in the fingers, thenspreading to other areas, such as the wrists, elbows,knees, and ankles. As the disease progresses, joint func-tion diminishes sharply and deformities occur, particular-ly the characteristic “swan’s neck” curling of the fingers.\\n• Goodpasture’s syndrome. Symptoms are similar to that\\nof iron deficiency anemia , including fatigue and pal-lor. Symptoms involving the lungs may range from a\\ncough that produces bloody sputum to outright hemor-\\nrhaging. Symptoms involving the urinary systeminclude blood in the urine and/or swelling.\\n• Grave’s disease. This disease is characterized by an\\nenlarged thyroid gland, weight loss without loss ofappetite, sweating, heart palpitations , nervousness,\\nand an inability to tolerate heat.\\n• Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. This disorder generally dis-\\nplays no symptoms.\\n• Pemphigus vulgaris. This disease is characterized by\\nblisters and deep lesions on the skin.\\n• Myasthenia gravis. Characterized by fatigue and mus-\\ncle weakness that at first may be confined to certainmuscle groups, but then may progress to the point ofparalysis. Myasthenia gravis patients often have expres-sionless faces as well as difficulty chewing and swal-lowing. If the disease progresses to the respiratory sys-tem, artificial respiration may be required.\\n• Scleroderma. Disorder is usually preceded by Ray-\\nnaud’s phenomenon. Symptoms that follow includepain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints, and the skintakes on a tight, shiny appearance. The digestive systemalso becomes involved, resulting in weight loss, appetiteloss, diarrhea ,constipation , and distention of the\\nabdomen. As the disease progresses, the heart, lungs,and kidneys become involved, and malignant hyperten-\\nsion causes death in approximately 30% of cases.\\n• Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. May be acute or\\nchronic. Symptoms include fatigue and abdominal ten-derness due to an enlarged spleen.\\n• Autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura. Characterized\\nby pinhead-size red dots on the skin, unexplainedbruises , bleeding from the nose and gums, and blood in\\nthe stool.\\n• Polymyositis and Dermatomyositis. In polymyositis,\\nsymptoms include muscle weakness, particularly in theshoulders or pelvis, that prevents the patient from per-forming everyday activities. In dermatomyositis, thesame muscle weakness is accompanied by a rash thatappears on the upper body, arms, and fingertips. A rashmay also appear on the eyelids, and the area around theeyes may become swollen.\\n• Pernicious anemia. Signs of pernicious anemia\\ninclude weakness, sore tongue, bleeding gums, andtingling in the extremities. Because the disease caus-es a decrease in stomach acid, nausea, vomiting, lossof appetite, weight loss, diarrhea, and constipationare possible. Also, because Vitamin B\\n12is essential\\nfor the nervous system function, the deficiency of itbrought on by the disease can result in a host of neu-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 423Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 423'),\n",

Characterized by excessive dry-\\nness of the mouth and eyes.\\n• Ankylosing spondylitis. Generally begins with lower\\nback pain that progresses up the spine. The pain mayeventually become crippling.\\n• Vasculitis. Symptoms depend upon the group of veins\\naffected and can range greatly.\\n• Type I diabetes mellitus. Characterized by fatigue and\\nan abnormally high level of glucose in the blood(hyperglycemia).\\n• Amyotrophic lateral schlerosis. First signs are stum-\\nbling and difficulty climbing stairs. Later, musclecramps and twitching may be observed as well asweakness in the hands making fastening buttons orturning a key difficult. Speech may become slowed orslurred. There may also be difficluty swallowing. Asrespiratory muscles atrophy, there is increased dangerof aspiration or lung infection.\\n• Guillain-Barre syndrome. Muscle weakness in the legs\\noccurs first, then the arms and face. Paresthesias (aprickly, tingling sensation) is also felt. This disorderaffects both sides of the body and may involve paralysisand the muscles that control breathing.\\n• Multiple sclerosis. Like Lou Gehrig’s disease, the first\\nsymptom may be clumsiness. Weakness or exhaustionis often reported, as well as blurry or double vision.There may be dizziness , depression, loss of bladder\\ncontrol, and muscle weakness so severe that the patientis confined to a wheelchair.\\nDiagnosis\\nA number of tests are involved in the diagnosis of\\nautoimmune diseases, depending on the particular dis-ease; e.g. blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, elec-tromylogram (measures muscle function), and magnetic\\nresonance imaging of the brain. Usually, these tests\\ndetermine the location and extent of damage or involve-ment. They are useful in charting progress of the diseaseand as baselines for treatment.\\nThe principle tool, however, for authenticating\\nautoimmune disease is antibody testing. Such testsinvolve measuring the level of antibodies found in theblood and determining if they react with specific anti-gens that would give rise to an autoimmune reaction. Anelevated amount of antibodies indicates that a humoralimmune reaction is occurring. Since elevated antibodylevels are also seen in common infections, they must be\\nruled out as the cause for the increased antibody levels.\\nAntibodies can also be typed by class. There are five\\nclasses of antibodies, and they can be separated in thelaboratory. The class IgG is usually associated withautoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, IgG class antibod-ies are also the main class of antibody seen in normalimmune responses.\\nThe most useful antibody tests involve introducing\\nthe patient’s antibodies to samples of his or her own tis-sue, usually thyroid, stomach, liver, and kidney tissue. Ifantibodies bind to the “self” tissue, it is diagnostic for anautoimmune disorder. Antibodies from a person withoutan autoimmune disorder would not react to “self” tissue.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of autoimmune diseases is specific to\\nthe disease, and usually concentrates on alleviating orpreventing symptoms rather than correcting the under-lying cause. For example, if a gland involved in anautoimmune reaction is not producing a hormone suchas insulin, administration of that hormone is required.Administration of a hormone, however, will restorethe function of the gland damaged by the autoimmunedisease.\\nThe other aspect of treatment is controlling the\\ninflammatory and proliferative nature of the immuneresponse. This is generally accomplished with two typesof drugs. Steroid compounds are used to control inflam-mation. There are many different steroids, each havingside effects. The proliferative nature of the immuneresponse is controlled with immunosuppressive drugs.These drugs work by inhibiting the replication of cellsand, therefore, also suppress non-immune cells leadingto side effects such as anemia.\\nSystemic enzyme therapy is a new treatment that is\\nshowing results for rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclero-sis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory dis-eases. Enzymes combinations of pancreatin, trypsin,chymotrypsin, bromelain, and papain help stimulate thebody’s own defenses, accelerate inflammation in order toreduce swelling and improve circulation, and break upthe immune complexes within the bloodstream. Symp-toms have been reduced using this treatment.\\nOther treatments that hold some promise are irradia-\\ntion of the spleen and gene therapy . Splenic irradiation\\nis touted to be a safe, alternative for patients with autoim-mune blood diseases, especially autoimmune hemolyticanemia, or others with compromised immune systems,such as HIV patients and the elderly. It is reported tohave few side effects and seems to be working. Cytokine\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 424Autoimmune disordersGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 424'),\n",

Since more women than men seem to beaffected by some of these disorders (e.g. lupus), someresearchers are looking into hormones as a factor. This,and gene therapy, may be the preventatives of the future.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAbbas, A.K., A.H. Lichtman, and J.S. Pober. Cellular and Mol-\\necular Immunology. Philadelphia: W.B.

This procedure dates back to the Romanera when few human dissections were performed; autop-sies were utilized, however, to determine the cause ofdeath in criminal cases. At the beginning of the proce-dure the exterior body is examined and then the internalorgans are removed and studied. Some pathologistsargue that more autopsies are performed than necessary.However, recent studies show that autopsies can detectmajor findings about a person’s condition that were notsuspected when the person was alive. And the growingawareness of the influence of genetic factors in diseasehas also emphasized the importance of autopsies.\\nDespite the usefulness of autopsies, fewer autopsies\\nhave been performed in the United States during the pastKEY TERMS\\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)—A group of diseases resulting from infection withthe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

A possible reason for this decline is concern\\nabout malpractice suits on the part of the treating physi-cian. Other possible reasons are that hospitals are per-forming fewer autopsies because of the expense orbecause modern technology, such as CT scans and mag-\\nnetic resonance imaging , can often provide sufficient\\ndiagnostic information. Nonetheless, federal regulatorsand pathology groups have begun to establish new guide-lines designed to increase the number and quality ofautopsies being performed.\\nMany experts are concerned that if the number of\\nautopsies increases, hospitals may be forced to chargefamilies a fee for the procedure as autopies are not nor-mally covered by insurance companies or Medicare. Yet,according to several pathologists, the benefit of the pro-cedure for families and doctors does justify the cost. Inmedical autopsies, physicians remain cautious to exam-ine only as much of the body as permitted according tothe wishes of the family. It is important to note thatautopsies can also provide peace of mind for thebereaved family in certain situations.\\nPreparation\\nIf a medical autopsy is being performed, written per-\\nmission is secured from the family of the deceased\\nAftercare\\nOnce the autopsy has been completed, the body is\\nprepared for final arrangements according to the family’swishes\\nRisks\\nThere are some risks of disease transmission from\\nthe deceased.

Larson, RPT\\nAviation medicine\\nDefinition\\nAlso known as aerospace medicine, flight medicine,\\nor space medicine, aviation medicine is a medical spe-cialty that focuses on the physical and psychologicalconditions associated with flying and space travel.\\nPurpose\\nSince flying airplanes and spacecraft involves great\\nrisk and physical demands, such as changes in gravityand oxygen, pilots and astronauts need medical expertsto protect their safety and the public’s safety.\\nDescription\\nPressure changes\\nIn the United States, the Federal Aviation Adminis-\\ntration (FAA) requires all pilots who fly above 14,500 ft(4,420 m) to be prepared for pressure changes caused bylower oxygen levels at high altitude. Pilots must eitherhave a pressurized cabin or access to an oxygen mask.Without these protections, they could experience hypox-ia, or altitude sickness . Hypoxia reduces the amount of\\noxygen in the brain, causing such symptoms asdizziness ,shortness of breath , and mental confusion.\\nThese symptoms could cause the pilot to lose control ofthe plane. Hypoxia can be treated with oxygen therapy.\\nRapid altitude increases and decreases can cause\\npain because there is an air pocket in the middle portion\\nof the ear. To equalize pressure in the ear, physicians typ-ically advise pilots and passengers to clear their sinusesby plugging their nose and blowing until the eardrums“pop.” Other options include yawning, swallowing orchewing gum. For people with a cold or a severelyblocked middle ear, the use of decongestants ,antihista-\\nmines , or nasal sprays may help. Without taking steps to\\nequalize pressure, the tympanic membrane could rupture,causing hearing loss , vertigo, dizziness, and nausea.\\nGravity’s impact\\nFighter pilots who fly high-performance jets can\\nexperience health problems during rapid acceleration andwhen executing tight turns at high speed. During thesemoves, a pilot experiences extreme gravity conditionsthat can pull blood away from the brain and heart andinto the lower body. This can cause the pilot to have tun-nel vision or pass out. To prevent these potentially deadlysituations, the military requires fighter pilots to wear spe-cial flight suits, or G suits, which have compartmentsthat fill with air or fluid to keep blood from pooling inthe lower body.\\nSome pilots, like the Blue Angels, use a technique\\ncalled the Valsalva Maneuver instead of G suits to pre-\\nvent black outs during high-performance flying. The Val-salva Maneuver involves grunting and tightening theabdominal muscles to stop blood from collecting in thewrong parts of the body.\\nPREVENTIVE CARE. Since any routine health problem\\nthat affects a pilot could mean the loss of hundreds oflives, aviation medicine specialists who work for com-mercial airlines and the military take special care to edu-cate pilots about proper diet, exercise and preventive\\nhealth tools. For example, physicians may frequentlyscreen pilots for vision changes caused by glaucoma or\\ncataracts . They also will check for hearing loss and\\nencourage the pilot to wear earplugs or headphones tobuffer engine noise. To monitor for heart disease, physi-cians will check blood pressure and may order diagnostictests such as an ECG or stress test .\\nMotion sickness\\nMany people experience nausea, vertigo, and disori-\\nentation when they first arrive in space. This is caused bychanges in the fluid in the inner ear, which is sensitive togravity and affects our sense of spatial orientation. Thesymptoms typically ease after several days, but oftenrecur when the astronaut returns to Earth. To treat thiscondition, physicians give astronauts motion sickness\\nmedication, such as lorazepam.\\nBone and muscle loss\\nIn zero-gravity conditions, astronauts lose bone and\\nmuscle mass.

In space, however, astronauts must work harder toprevent bone and muscle loss. Exercise is an importanttreatment. Crew members may use an exercise cycle orresistive rubber bands to stay in shape. Physicians also maygive them medication to prevent bone loss and prescribenutritional supplements, such as a mixture of essentialamino acids and carbohydrates, to limit muscle atrophy.\\nRadiation\\nAnother health threat to space travelers is radiation.\\nHarmful rays can alter the DNA in human cells andcause cancer . Excess radiation also can weaken the\\nimmune system. To prevent these problems, physiciansmay give astronauts nutritional supplements.

Scientists are con-cerned about this dilemma because it could be dangerousif the crew members need to make an emergency exit.One way to prevent this problem, which is caused by adrop in blood pressure, is to have the astronauts drinkextra fluids and increase salt intake to increase blood vol-ume. Physicians also may prescribe medication thatcauses blood vessels to contract. As another precaution,astronauts also put on protective flight suits, or G suits,before they re-enter the earth’s atmosphere.KEY TERMS\\nG suits —Special flight suits, worn by fighter pilots,\\nwhich have compartments that fill with air or fluidto keep blood from pooling in the lower body dur-ing rapid acceleration and tight turns.\\nHypoxia —Hypoxia, or altitude sickness, reduces\\nthe amount of oxygen in the brain causing suchsymptoms as dizziness, shortness of breath, andmental confusion.\\nTympanic membrane —A structure in the middle\\near that can rupture if pressure in the ear is notequalized during airplane ascents and descents.\\nValsalva Maneuver —Pilots grunt and tighten their\\nabdominal muscles to prevent black outs duringhigh-performance flying.Resources\\nBOOKS\\nDehart, Roy L.

He lefthis home for the United States in 1970 and completedresidencies in internal medicine and endocrinology. Hewent on to teaching posts at major medical institutions—Tufts University and Boston University schools of medi-\\ncine—while establishing a very successful private prac-tice. By the time he was thirty-five, Chopra had becomechief of staff at New England Memorial Hospital.\\nDisturbed by Western medicine’s reliance on med-\\nication, he began a search for alternatives and discoveredone in the teachings of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, anIndian spiritualist who had gained a cult following in thelate sixties teaching Transcendental Meditation (TM).Chopra began practicing TM fervently and eventually metthe Maharishi. In 1985 Chopra established the AyurvedicHealth Center for Stress Management and BehavioralMedicine in Lancaster, Massachusetts, where he beganhis practice of integrating the best aspects of Eastern andWestern medicine.\\nIn 1993, he published Creating Affluence: Wealth\\nConsciousness in the Field of All Possibilities , and the\\nenormously successful best seller, Ageless Body, Timeless\\nMind . In the latter he presents his most radical thesis: that\\naging is not the inevitable deterioration of organs andmind that we have been traditionally taught to think of itas. It is a process that can be influenced, slowed down,and even reversed with the correct kinds of therapies,almost all of which are self-administered or self-taught.He teaches that applying a regimen of nutritional bal-ance, meditation, and emotional clarity characterized bysuch factors as learning to easily and quickly expressanger, for instance, can lead to increased lifespans of upto 120 years.\\n(AP/Wide World Photos.

Aided by the efforts of DeepakChopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasinglyaccepted alternative medical treatment in America duringthe last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has writtenseveral bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He alsohelped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine inLa Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that trainsphysicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces herbalremedies, and conducts research and documentation ofits healing techniques.\\nKey ideas\\nTo understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary to\\nhave an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the body.The basic life force in the body is prana , which is also\\nfound in the elements and is similar to the Chinesenotion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and\\nexpert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,nor any of its chemical constituents. It is in food, water,and in the sunlight, yet it is not vitamin, heat, or light-rays. Food, water, air, etc., are only the media throughwhich the prana is carried.”\\nIn Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that con-\\ntain prana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These ele-ments interact and are further organized in the humanbody as three main categories or basic physiologicalprinciples in the body that govern all bodily functionsknown as the doshas . The three doshas are vata, pitta,\\nand kapha . Each person has a unique blend of the three\\ndoshas, known as the person’s prakriti , which is why\\nAyurvedic treatment is always individualized. InAyurveda, disease is viewed as a state of imbalance inone or more of a person’s doshas, and an Ayurvedicphysician strives to adjust and balance them, using avariety of techniques.The vata dosha is associated with air and ether, and\\nin the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo-ple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned,and very energetic and mentally restless. When vata isout of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper-activity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches.\\nPitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, it\\nis responsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta char-acteristics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strongdigestion, and good mental concentration. Pitta imbal-ances show up as anger and aggression and stress-relat-ed conditions like gastritis , ulcers, liver problems, and\\nhypertension.\\nThe kapha dosha is associated with water and earth.\\nPeople characterized as kapha are generally large orheavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow,calm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional-ly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity,fatigue ,bronchitis , and sinus problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as an\\nimbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic processstrives to determine which doshas are underactive oroveractive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over acourse of days in order for the Ayurvedic physician tomost accurately determine what parts of the body arebeing affected. To diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physi-cians often use long questionnaires and interviews todetermine a person’s dosha patterns and physical andpsychological histories. Ayurvedic physicians also intri-cately observe the pulse, tongue, face, lips, eyes, and fin-gernails for abnormalities or patterns that they believecan indicate deeper problems in the internal systems.Some Ayurvedic physicians also use laboratory tests toassist in diagnosis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 430Ayurvedic medicineAyurvedic Body Types\\nVata Pitta Kapha\\nPhysical characteristics Thin Average build Large build\\nProminent features Fair, thin hair Wavy, thick hairCool, dry skin Warm, moist skin Pale, cool, oily skinConstipation Ulcers, heartburn, and hemorrhoids Obesity, allergies, and sinus problemsCramps Acne High cholesterol\\nEmotional characteristics Moody Intense Relaxed\\nVivacious Quick tempered Not easily angeredImaginative Intelligent AffectionateEnthusiastic Loving TolerantIntuitive Articulate Compassionate\\nBehavioral characteristics Unscheduled sleep and meal times Orderly Slow, graceful\\nNervous disorders Structured sleep and meal times Long sleeper and slow eaterAnxiety Perfectionist ProcrastinationGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 430'),\n",

Usually the firstmethod of treatment involves some sort of detoxificationand cleansing of the body, in the belief that accumulatedtoxins must be removed before any other methods oftreatment will be effective. Methods of detoxificationinclude therapeutic vomiting, laxatives , medicated ene-\\nmas,fasting , and cleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayur-\\nvedic clinics combine all of these cleansing methods intointensive sessions known as panchakarma . Panchakarma\\ncan take several days or even weeks and they are morethan elimination therapies. They also include herbalizedoil massage and herbalized heat treatments . After purifi-\\ncation, Ayurvedic physicians use herbal and mineralremedies to balance the body as well. Ayurvedic medicinecontains a vast knowledge of the use of herbs for specifichealth problems.\\nAyurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people live\\ntheir lives from day to day, believing that proper lifestylesand routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and preven-tion. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of exercise to\\nbuild strength and health, and also advises massage thera-py and self-massage as ways of increasing circulation andreducing stress . Yogic breathing techniques and medita-\\ntion are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regimen, toreduce stress and improve mental energy.\\nOf all treatments, though, diet is one of the most\\nbasic and widely used therapy in the Ayurvedic system.An Ayurvedic diet can be a very well planned and indi-vidualized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are sixbasic tastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astrin-gent. Certain tastes and foods can either calm or aggra-vate a particular dosha. For instance, sweet, sour, andsalty decrease vata problems and increase kapha. Sour,salty, and pungent can increase pitta. After an Ayurvedicphysician determines a person’s dosha profile, they willrecommend a specific diet to correct imbalances andincrease health. The Ayurvedic diet emphasizes primarilyvegetarian foods of high quality and freshness, tailored tothe season and time of day. Cooling foods are eaten inthe summer and heating ones in the winter, always withina person’s dosha requirements. In daily routine, the heav-iest meal of the day should be lunch, and dinner shouldeaten well before bedtime, to allow for complete diges-tion. Also, eating meals in a calm manner with properchewing and state of mind is important, as is combiningfoods properly and avoiding overeating.\\nCost\\nCosts of Ayurvedic treatments can vary, with initial\\nconsultations running anywhere from $40 to over $100,KEY TERMS\\nDosha —One of three constitutional types, either\\nvata, pitta, or kapha, found in Ayurvedic medicine.\\nMeditation —Technique of calming the mind.\\nPanchakarma —Intensive Ayurvedic cleansing and\\ndetoxification program.\\nPrakriti —An individual’s unique dosha pattern.\\nPrana —Basic life energy found in the elements.\\nYoga—System of body and breathing exercises.\\nwith follow-up visits costing less. Herbal treatments may\\ncost from $10 to $50 per month, and are often availablefrom health food or bulk herb stores. Some clinics offerpanchakarma, the intensive Ayurvedic detoxificationtreatment, which can include overnight stays for up toseveral weeks. The prices for these programs can varysignificantly, depending on the services and length ofstay. Insurance reimbursement may depend on whetherthe primary physician is a licensed M.D.\\nPreparations\\nAyurveda is a mind/body system of health that con-\\ntains some ideas foreign to the Western scientificmodel. Those people considering Ayurveda shouldapproach it with an open mind and willingness toexperiment. Also, because Ayurveda is a whole-bodysystem of healing and health, patience and disciplineare helpful, as some conditions and diseases arebelieved to be brought on by years of bad health habitsand require time and effort to correct. Finally, theAyurvedic philosophy believes that each person has theability to heal themselves, so those considering Ayurve-da should be prepared to bring responsibility and partic-ipation into the treatment.\\nPrecautions\\nAn Ayurvedic practitioner should always be consulted.\\nSide effects\\nDuring Ayurvedic detoxification programs, some\\npeople report fatigue, muscle soreness, and general sick-ness. Also, as Ayurveda seeks to release mental stressesand psychological problems from the patient, some peo-ple can experience mental disturbances and depressionduring treatment, and psychological counseling may bepart of a sound program.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 431Ayurvedic medicineGEM - 0001 to 0432 - A  10/22/03 1:43 PM  Page 431'),\n",

By 1995, fewer than 500 cases of babesiosis had\\nbeen reported in the United States. The disease occursprimarily in New England and New York, especially onthe coastal islands. However, cases have occurred inother parts of the United States. Because of tick activity,the risk for babesiosis is highest during June and July.\\nTicks are small, blood-sucking arachnids. Although\\nsome ticks carry disease-causing organisms, most do not.Babesia microti is spread to humans through the bite of\\nthe tick Ixodes scapularis (also called Ixodes dammini ).\\nIxodes scapularis , called the “blacklegged deer tick,” usu-\\nally feeds on deer and mice. A tick picks up the parasitesby feeding on an infected mouse and then passes them onby biting a new host, possibly a human. To pass on theparasites, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36-48hours. Once in the bloodstream, Babesia microti enters a\\nred blood cell, reproduces by cell division, and destroysthe cell. Humans infected with Babesia microti produce\\nantibodies that can be helpful in diagnosing the infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBabesia microti live and divide within red blood\\ncells, destroying the cells and causing anemia. Themajority of people who are infected have no visiblesymptoms. In those who become ill, symptoms appearone to six weeks following the tick bite. Because theticks are small, many patients have no recollection of atick bite. The symptoms are flu-like and include tired-ness, loss of appetite, fever , drenching sweats, and mus-\\ncle pain . Nausea, vomiting, headache , shaking chills,\\nblood in the urine, and depression can occur.\\nPersons who are over 40 years old, have had their\\nspleen removed (splenectomized), and/or have a seriousdisease ( cancer ,AIDS , etc.) are at a greater risk for\\nsevere babesiosis. In severe cases of babesiosis, up to85% of the blood cells can be infected. This causes aserious, possibly fatal, blood deficiency.\\nDiagnosis\\nBabesiosis can be diagnosed by examining a blood\\nsample microscopically and detecting the presence ofBabesia microti within the blood cells. The blood can also\\nbe checked for the presence of antibodies to the parasite.\\nTreatment\\nIn serious cases, babesiosis is treated with a combi-\\nnation of clindamycin (Cleocin) and quinine. Clin-damycin is given by injection and quinine is given orallythree to four times a day for four to seven days. Toreduce the number of parasites in the blood, severely illpatients have been treated with blood transfusions.\\nPrognosis\\nOtherwise healthy patients will recover completely.\\nBabesiosis may last several months without treatmentand is a severe, potentially fatal disease in splenec-tomized patients.\\nPrevention\\nThe only prevention for babesiosis is to minimize\\nexposure to ticks by staying on trails when walkingB\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 433GEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 433'),\n",

According to the U.S. Centers for Dis-ease Control and Prevention (CDC), an HIV patient diag-nosed with bacillary angiomatosis is considered to haveprogressed to full-blown AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nScientists have recently isolated two varieties of the\\nBartonella bacteria as the cause of bacillary angiomato-sis:Bartonella (formerly Rochalimaeaquintana ) and B.\\nhenselae (cause of cat-scratch disease).\\nB. quintana infection is known popularly as trench\\nfever , and is the infection associated with body lice that\\nsickened European troops during World War I. Lice carrythe bacteria, and can transmit the infection to humans.The incidence of trench fever was believed to have faded\\naway with the end of World War I. It was not diagnosedin the United States until 1992, when 10 cases werereported among homeless Seattle men.\\nThe related bacteria B. henselae was first identified\\nseveral years ago as the cause of cat-scratch fever. It alsocan lead to bacillary angiomatosis in AIDS patients.Bacillary angiomatosis caused by this bacteria is trans-mitted to AIDS patients from cat fleas.\\nThese two different types of bacteria both cause\\nbacillary angiomatosis, a disease which is characterizedby wildly proliferating blood vessels that form tumor-likemasses in the skin and organs. The nodules that appear inbacillary angiomatosis are firm and don’t turn white whenpressed. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, innumbers ranging from one to 100. They are rarely foundon palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or in the mouth.As the number of lesions increase, the patient may devel-op a high fever, sweats, chills, poor appetite, vomiting,and weight loss. If untreated, infection may be fatal.\\nIn addition to the basic disease process, the two dif-\\nferent types of bacteria cause some slightly differentsymptoms. Patients infected with B. henselae also expe-\\nrience blood-filled cysts within the liver and abnormalliver function, whereas B. quintana patients may have\\ntumor growths in the bone.\\nDiagnosis\\nThis life-threatening but curable infection is often\\nmisdiagnosed, because it may be mistaken for other con-ditions (such as Kaposi’s sarcoma).

This may occur through a wound or infection, orthrough a surgical procedure or injection. Bacteremiamay cause no symptoms and resolve without treatment,or it may produce fever and other symptoms of infection.\\nIn some cases, bacteremia leads to septic shock , a poten-\\ntially life-threatening condition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nSeveral types of bacteria live on the surface of the\\nskin or colonize the moist linings of the urinary tract,lower digestive tract, and other internal surfaces. Thesebacteria are normally harmless as long as they are kept incheck by the body’s natural barriers and the immune sys-tem. People in good health with strong immune systemsrarely develop bacteremia. However, when bacteria areintroduced directly into the circulatory system, especial-ly in a person who is ill or undergoing aggressive med-ical treatment, the immune system may not be able tocope with the invasion, and symptoms of bacteremia maydevelop. For this reason, bacteremia is most common inpeople who are already affected by or being treated forsome other medical problem. In addition, medical treat-ment may bring a person in contact with new types ofbacteria that are more invasive than those already resid-ing in that person’s body, further increasing the likeli-hood of bacterial infection.\\nConditions which increase the chances of develop-\\ning bacteremia include:\\n• immune suppression, either due to HIV infection or\\ndrug therapy\\n• antibiotic therapy which changes the balance of bacteri-\\nal types in the body\\n• prolonged or severe illness\\n• alcoholism or other drug abuse• malnutrition• diseases or drug therapy that cause ulcers in the\\nintestines, e.g. chemotherapy for cancer\\nCommon immediate causes of bacteremia include:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 435BacteremiaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 435'),\n",

Since bacteremia is usually associated with\\nan existing infection elsewhere in the body, finding andtreating this infection is an important part of treatment.\\nBacteremia may cause no symptoms, but may be dis-\\ncovered through a blood test for another condition. In thissituation, it may not need to be treated, except in patientsespecially at risk for infection, such as those with heartvalve defects or whose immune systems are suppressed.\\nPrognosis\\nPrompt antibiotic therapy usually succeeds in clear-\\ning bacteria from the bloodstream.

Bad breath, either real or imagined,can have a significant impact on a person’s social andprofessional life.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBad breath can be caused by a number of problems.\\nOral diseases, fermentation of food particles in themouth, sinus infections, and unclean dentures can allcontribute to mouth odor. Many non-oral diseases, suchas lung infections, kidney failure, or severe liver disease,can also cause bad breath, though rarely. Many peoplethink that bad breath can originate in the stomach orintestines; this is extremely rare. The esophagus is usual-ly collapsed and closed, and, although a belch may carryodor up from the stomach, the chance of bad breathbeing caused from air continually escaping from thestomach is remote. Cigarette smoke can cause badbreath, not only in the cigarette smoker, but also in onewho is constantly exposed to second-hand smoke.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is\\nto ask someone who is trustworthy and discrete. This isusually not too difficult. Another, more private, method ofdetermining if one has bad breath is to lick one’s wrist,wait until it dries, then smell the area. Scraping the reararea of the tongue with a plastic spoon, then smelling thespoon, is another method one can use to assess bad breath.KEY TERMS\\nHalitosis —The medical term for bad breath.\\nTreatment\\nThe most effective treatment of bad breath is to treat\\nthe cause. Poor oral hygiene can be improved by regular\\nbrushing and flossing, as well as regular dental checkups.Gentle brushing of the tongue should be part of daily oralhygiene. In addition to good oral hygiene, the judicioususe of mouthwashes is helpful. Mouth dryness, experi-enced at night or during fasting , or due to certain med-\\nications and medical conditions, can contribute to badbreath. Dryness can be avoided by drinking adequateamounts of water. Chewing gum may be beneficial.\\nAs mentioned, some medications, such as some high\\nblood pressure medications, can cause dry mouth . If this\\nproblem is significant, a medication change, under thesupervision of one’s health care provider, may improvethe dry-mouth condition. Oral or sinus infections, oncediagnosed, can be treated medically, usually with antibi-\\notics . Lung infections and kidney or liver problems will,\\nof course, need medical treatment\\nAlternative treatment\\nDepending on the cause, a multitude of alternative\\ntherapeutic remedies can be used. For example, sinusitis\\ncan be treated with steam inhalation of essential oilsand/or herbs.\\nPrognosis\\nMost bad breath can be treated successfully with\\ngood oral hygiene and/or medical care. Occasionally, forpatients who feel that these therapies are unsuccessful,some delusional or obsessive behavior pattern might per-tain, and mental health counseling may be appropriate.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, Robert, ed.

Coordi-\\nnation is the capacity to move through a complex set ofmovements. Balance and coordination depend on theinteraction of multiple body organs and systems includ-ing the eyes, ears, brain and nervous system, cardiovas-cular system, and muscles. Tests or examination of anyor all of these organs or systems may be necessary todetermine the causes of loss of balance, dizziness , or the\\ninability to coordinate movement or activities.\\nPurpose\\nTests of balance and coordination, and the examina-\\ntion of the organs and systems that influence balance andcoordination, can help to identify causes of dizziness,fainting , falling, or incoordination.\\nPrecautions\\nTests for balance and coordination should be con-\\nducted in a safe and controlled area where patients willnot experience injury if they become dizzy or fall.\\nDescription\\nAssessment of balance and coordination can include\\ndiscussion of the patient’s medical history and a com-plete physical examination including evaluation of the\\nheart, head, eyes, and ears. A slow pulse or heart rate, orvery low blood pressure may indicate a circulatory sys-tem problem, which can cause dizziness or fainting. Dur-ing the examination, the patient may be asked to rotatethe head from side to side while sitting up or while lyingdown with the head and neck extended over the edge ofthe examination table. If these tests produce dizziness ora rapid twitching of the eyeballs ( nystagmus ), the\\npatient may have a disorder of the inner ear, which isresponsible for maintaining balance.\\nAn examination of the eyes and ears may also give\\nclues to episodes of dizziness or incoordination. Thepatient may be asked to focus on a light or on a distantpoint or object, and to look up, down, left, and right mov-ing only the eyes while the eyes are examined. Problemswith vision may, in themselves, contribute to balance andcoordination disturbances, or may indicate more seriousproblems of the nervous system or brain function. Hear-\\ning loss , fluid in the inner ear, or ear infection might\\nindicate the cause of balance and coordination problems.\\nVarious physical tests may also be used. A patient\\nmay be asked to walk a straight line, stand on one foot,or touch a finger to the nose to help assess balance. Thepatient may be asked to squeeze or push against thedoctor’s hands, to squat down, to bend over, stand ontiptoes or stand on their heels. Important aspects ofthese tests include holding positions for a certain num-ber of seconds, successfully repeating movements acertain number of times, and repeating the test accu-rately with eyes closed. The patient’s reflexes may alsobe tested. For example, the doctor may tap on the knees,ankles, and elbows with a small rubber mallet to testnervous system functioning.

These\\nare men who have a foreskin, which is the “hood” of softskin that partially covers the head of the penis. In balanitis,the head and foreskin become red and inflamed. (In circum-cised men, who lack a foreskin, these symptoms only affectthe tip of the penis.) The condition often occurs due to thefungus Candida albicans , the same organism that causes\\nvaginal yeast infections in women. Balanitis (which is alsoreferred to as balanoposthitis) can be caused by a variety ofother fungal or bacterial infections, or may occur due to asensitivity reaction to common chemical agents.\\nUncircumcised men are more at risk for balanitis\\ndue to the presence of the foreskin. The snug fit of theforeskin around the top of the penis tends to create adamp, warm environment that encourages the growth ofmicroorganisms. Most of the organisms associated withbalanitis are already present on the penis, but in verysmall numbers. However, if the area between the headand foreskin is not cleansed thoroughly on a regularbasis, these organisms can multiply and lead to infection.\\nDiabetes can increase the risk of developing the con-\\ndition.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBalanitis is usually a result of poor hygiene—for\\nexample, neglecting to bathe for several days.

In other cases, bal-anitis may occur due to an allergic reaction: Some menmay be sensitive to chemicals found in harsh soaps, laun-dry detergents, or contraceptive creams. Men who con-tract a sexually transmitted disease (STD) such as\\ntrichimoniasis may also develop symptoms.\\nThe symptoms of balanitis are limited to the fore-\\nskin and head of the penis (in circumcised men, only thehead is affected). These include redness, inflammation,pain , discharge, sore or itchy skin, and difficulty retract-\\ning the foreskin.\\nDiagnosis\\nBalanitis is usually diagnosed based on a brief physi-\\ncal examination . This may be conducted by your regular\\nhealth care provider or by a urologist, the type of doctorwho specializes in such disorders. The doctor may take asample of the discharge (if any) to determine the nature ofthe possible infection. A urine test may be recommendedto evaluate glucose (sugar) levels in the urine. Balanitistreatment is typically covered by medical insurance.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of balanitis depends on the specific\\ncause, which can vary from case to case. Antibiotics are\\nused to treat bacterial infections, while topical antifun-gals such as clotrimazole can combat balanitis caused byCandida . If an allergic reaction is causing symptoms, the\\ngoal is to identify the chemical agent responsible. Oint-ments or creams may be used to ease skin irritation.\\nNo matter what the cause, it is important to thor-\\noughly clean the penis on a daily basis in order to allevi-ate symptoms. If the condition keeps occurring, or if theinflammation is interfering with urination, circumcision\\nmay be advised.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAccording to practitioners of alternative medicine,\\ncertain herbs may be effective in controlling or prevent-ing yeast infections—a common cause of balanitis.These remedies include garlic, calendula, and gold-enseal. Eating yogurt that contains acidophilus may alsohelp to clear up a Candida infection.\\nPrognosis\\nMost cases go away quickly once the cause is identi-\\nfied and treated. However, regular bouts of balanitis canresult in urethral stricture.KEY TERMS\\nAcidophilus —A bacteria believed to combat yeast\\ninfections.\\nCircumcision —The surgical removal of the fore-\\nskin.\\nUrethral stricture —A narrowing of the urethra\\n(urine tube).\\nPrevention\\nProper hygiene is the best way to avoid balanitis.\\nCircumcision is sometimes performed to prevent repeat-ed cases.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nSmith, Donald R.

It is primarily a\\ndisease of the tropics, although it is also found in cooler,temperate climates. Most persons with balantidiasis donot exhibit any noticeable symptoms (asymptomatic),but a few individuals will develop diarrhea with blood\\nand mucus and an inflamed colon (colitis).\\nDescription\\nBalantidiasis is caused by Balantidium coli , a para-\\nsitic protozoan that infects the large intestine.

During its life\\ncycle, this organism exists in two very different forms: theinfective cyst or capsuled form, which cannot move butcan survive outside the human body because of its thick,protective covering; and the disease-producing form, thetrophozoite, which although capable of moving, cannotsurvive once excreted in the feces and, therefore, cannotinfect others. In the digestive tract, the cysts are transport-ed to the intestine where the walls of the cysts are brokenopen by digestive secretions, releasing the mobile tropho-zoites. Once released within the intestine, the tropho-zoites multiply by feeding on intestinal bacteria or byinvading the lining of the large intestine. Within the liningof the large intestine, the trophozoites secrete a substancethat destroys intestinal tissue and creates sores (ulcers) orabscesses. Trophozoites eventually form new cysts thatare carried through the digestive tract and excreted in thefeces. Under favorable temperature and humidity condi-tions, the cysts can survive in soil or water for weeks tomonths, ready to begin the cycle again.\\nMost individuals with balantidiasis have no notice-\\nable symptoms. Even though these individuals may notfeel ill, they are still capable of infecting others by per-son-to-person contact or by contaminating food or waterwith cysts that others may ingest, for example, by prepar-ing food with unwashed hands.\\nThe most common symptoms of balantidiasis are\\nchronic diarrhea or severe colitis with abdominal cramps,pain , and bloody stools. Complications may include\\nintestinal perforation in which the intestinal wallbecomes torn, but the organisms do not spread to otherparts of the body in the blood stream.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of balantidiasis, as with other similar dis-\\neases, can be complicated, partly because symptoms mayor may not be present. A diagnosis of balantidiasis may beconsidered when a patient has diarrhea combined with apossible history of recent exposure to amebiasis through\\ntravel, contact with infected persons, or anal intercourse.\\nSpecifically, a diagnosis of balantidiasis is made by\\nfinding B. coli cysts or trophozoites in the patient’s stoolsor by finding trophozoites in tissue samples (biopsy)\\ntaken from the large bowel. A diagnostic blood test hasnot yet been developed.\\nStool examination\\nThis test involves microscopically examining a stool\\nsample for the presence of cysts and/or trophozoites of B.\\ncoli.\\nSigmoidoscopy\\nTo take a tissue sample from the large intestine, a\\nprocedure called a sigmoidoscopy is performed. During\\na sigmoidoscopy, a thin, flexible instrument is used tovisually examine the intestinal lining and obtain smalltissue specimens.\\nTreatment\\nPatients with balantidiasis are treated with prescrip-\\ntion medication, typically consisting of a ten day courseof either tetracycline or metronidazole. Alternative drugsthat have proven effective in treating balantidiasisinclude iodoquinol or paromomycin.\\nPrognosis\\nAlthough somewhat dependent on the patient’s over-\\nall health, in general, the prognosis for most patients withbalantidiasis is good. Severely infected patients occa-sionally die as a result of a tear in the intestinal wall(intestinal perforation) and consequent loss of blood.\\nPrevention\\nThere are no immunization procedures or medica-\\ntions that can be taken prior to potential exposure to pre-vent balantidiasis. Moreover, people who have had thedisease can become reinfected. Prevention requires effec-tive personal and community hygiene. Specific safe-guards include the following:\\n• Purification of drinking water. Water can be purified by\\nfiltering, boiling, or treatment with iodine.\\n• Proper food handling. Measures include protecting\\nfood from contamination by flies, cooking food proper-ly, washing one’s hands after using the bathroom andbefore cooking or eating, and avoiding foods that can-not be cooked or peeled when traveling in countrieswith high rates of balantidiasis.\\n• Careful disposal of human feces.• Monitoring the contacts of balantidiasis patients. The\\nstools of family members and sexual partners of infect-ed persons should be tested for the presence of cysts ortrophozoites.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 441BalantidiasisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 441'),\n",

Theyare called aortic valve, pulmonary valve, mitral valve,and tricuspid valve. The valves open and close to regu-late the blood flow from one chamber to the next. Theyare vital to the efficient functioning of the heart.\\nIn some people the valves are too narrow (a condi-\\ntion called stenosis). Balloon valvuloplasty is performedon children and adults to improve valve function andblood flow by enlarging the valve opening. It is a treat-ment for aortic, mitral, and pulmonary stenosis. Balloonvalvuloplasty has the best results as a treatment for nar-rowed pulmonary valves. Results in treating narrowingof the mitral valve are generally good. It is more difficultto perform and less successful in treating narrowing ofthe aortic valve.\\nDescription\\nBalloon valvuloplasty is a procedure in which a thin\\ntube (catheter) that has a small deflated balloon at the tipis inserted through the skin in the groin area into a bloodvessel, and then is threaded up to the opening of the nar-rowed heart valve. The balloon is inflated, which stretch-es the valve open. This procedure cures many valveobstructions. It is also called balloon enlargement of anarrowed heart valve.\\nThe procedure is performed in a cardiac catheteriza-\\ntion laboratory and takes up to four hours. The patient is\\nusually awake, but is given local anesthesia to make the areawhere the catheter is inserted numb. After the site where thecatheter will be inserted is prepared and anesthetized, thecardiologist inserts a catheter into the appropriate blood ves-sel, then passes a balloon-tipped catheter through the firstcatheter. Guided by a video monitor and an x ray, the physi-cian slowly threads the catheter into the heart. The deflatedballoon is positioned in the valve opening, then is inflatedrepeatedly. The inflated balloon widens the valve’s openingby splitting the valve leaflets apart. Once the valve iswidened, the balloon-tipped catheter is removed. The othercatheter remains in place for 6 to 12 hours because in somecases the procedure must be repeated.\\nPreparation\\nFor at least six hours before balloon valvuloplasty,\\nthe patient will have to avoid eating or drinking anything.An intravenous line is inserted so that medications can beadministered. The patient’s groin area is shaved andcleaned with an antiseptic. About an hour before the pro-cedure, the patient is given an oral sedative such asdiazepam (Valium).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 442Balloon valvuloplastyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 442'),\n",

An electrocardiogram, which is a record of theelectrical impulses in the heart, is done. The leg in whichthe catheter was inserted is temporarily prevented frommoving. The skin condition is monitored. The insertionsite, which will be covered by a sandbag, is observed forbleeding until the catheter is removed. Intravenous fluidswill be given to help eliminate the x-ray dye; intravenousblood thinners or other medications to dilate the coronaryarteries may be given. Pain medication is available.\\nFor at least 30 minutes after removal of the catheter,\\ndirect pressure is applied to the site of insertion; after thisa pressure dressing will be applied. Following dischargefrom the hospital, the patient can usually resume normalactivities. After balloon valvuloplasty lifelong follow-upis necessary because valves sometimes degenerate ornarrowing recurs, making surgery necessary.\\nRisks\\nBalloon valvuloplasty can have serious complica-\\ntions. For example, the valve can become misshapen sothat it doesn’t close completely, which makes the condi-tion worse. Embolism , where pieces of the valve break\\noff and travel to the brain or the lungs, is another possiblerisk. If the procedure causes severe damage to the valveleaflets, immediate surgery is required.

Brain injury may becaused by an accidental head injury or a medical condi-\\ntion, such as stroke , tumor, or infection. When the brain\\nis injured, fluids accumulate in the brain, causing it toswell. The skull does not allow for the expansion of thebrain; in effect, the brain becomes compressed.\\nIf the pressure does not abate, oxygenated blood\\nmay not reach all areas of the brain. Also, the brain tissuemay be forced against hard, bony edges on the interior ofthe skull. In either case, the brain tissue may die, causingpermanent brain damage or death .\\nBarbiturates reduce the metabolic rate of brain tis-\\nsue, as well as the cerebral blood flow.

The side effects ofbarbiturates, especially the depressive effect on the car-diovascular system, can be too risky for some patients.Other side effects include impaired gastrointestinalmotility and impaired immune response and infection.Since barbiturates depress activity in the brain, measure-ments of brain activity may be unreliable.

Also known\\nas sedative-hypnotic drugs, barbiturates make people veryrelaxed, calm, and sleepy. These drugs are sometimesused to help patients relax before surgery. Some may alsobe used to control seizures (convulsions). Although barbi-turates have been used to treat nervousness and sleepproblems, they have generally been replaced by othermedicines for these purposes.\\nThese medicines may become habit forming and\\nshould not be used to relieve everyday anxiety and ten-\\nsion or to treat sleeplessness over long periods.\\nDescription\\nBarbiturates are available only with a physician’s\\nprescription and are sold in capsule, tablet, liquid, andinjectable forms. Some commonly used barbiturates arephenobarbital (Barbita) and secobarbital (Seconal).\\nRecommended dosage\\nRecommended dosage depends on the type of barbi-\\nturate and other factors such as the patient’s age and thecondition for which the medicine is being taken. Checkwith the physician who prescribed the drug or the phar-macist who filled the prescription for the correct dosage.\\nAlways take barbiturates exactly as directed. Never\\ntake larger or more frequent doses, and do not take thedrug for longer than directed. If the medicine does notseem to be working, even after taking it for severalweeks, do not increase the dosage. Instead, check withthe physician who prescribed the medicine.\\nDo not stop taking this medicine suddenly without\\nfirst checking with the physician who prescribed it. Itmay be necessary to taper down gradually to reduce thechance of withdrawal symptoms. If it is necessary to stoptaking the drug, check with the physician for instructionson how to stop.\\nPrecautions\\nSee a physician regularly while taking barbiturates.\\nThe physician will check to make sure the medicine isworking as it should and will note unwanted side effects.Because barbiturates work on the central nervous\\nsystem, they may add to the effects of alcohol and otherdrugs that slow the central nervous system, such as anti-\\nhistamines , cold medicine, allergy medicine, sleep aids,\\nmedicine for seizures, tranquilizers, some pain relievers,\\nand muscle relaxants . They may also add to the effects\\nof anesthetics, including those used for dental proce-dures. The combined effects of barbiturates and alcoholor other CNS depressants (drugs that slow the centralnervous system) can be very dangerous, leading tounconsciousness or even death . Anyone taking barbitu-\\nrates should not drink alcohol and should check with hisor her physician before taking any medicines classifiedas CNS depressants.\\nTaking an overdose of barbiturates or combining\\nbarbiturates with alcohol or other central nervous systemdepressants can cause unconsciousness and even death.Anyone who shows signs of an overdose or a reaction tocombining barbiturates with alcohol or other drugsshould get emergency medical help immediately. Signsinclude:\\n• severe drowsiness\\n• breathing problems• slurred speech• staggering\\n• slow heartbeat\\n• severe confusion• severe weakness\\nBarbiturates may change the results of certain med-\\nical tests. Before having medical tests, anyone taking thismedicine should alert the health care professional incharge.\\nPeople may feel drowsy, dizzy, lightheaded, or less\\nalert when using these drugs. These effects may evenoccur the morning after taking a barbiturate at bedtime.Because of these possible effects, anyone who takesthese drugs should not drive, use machines or do any-thing else that might be dangerous until they have foundout how the drugs affect them.\\nBarbiturates may cause physical or mental depen-\\ndence when taken over long periods. Anyone who showsthese signs of dependence should check with his or herphysician right away:\\n• the need to take larger and larger doses of the medicine\\nto get the same effect\\n• a strong desire to keep taking the medicine\\n• withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, nausea or vom-\\niting, convulsions, trembling, or sleep problems, whenthe medicine is stopped\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 445BarbituratesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 445'),\n",

There are two types of this test:the single-contrast technique where barium sulfate isinjected into the rectum in order to gain a profile view ofthe large intestine; and the double-contrast (or “air con-trast”) technique where air is inserted into the rectum.\\nPurpose\\nA barium enema may be performed for a variety of\\nreasons, including to aid in the diagnosis of colon andrectal cancer (or colorectal cancer ), and inflammatory\\ndisease. Detection of polyps (a benign growth in the tis-sue lining of the colon and rectum), diverticula (a pouchpushing out from the colon), and structural changes inthe large intestine can also be established with this test.The double-contrast barium enema is the best method fordetecting small tumors (such as polyps), early inflamma-tory disease, and bleeding caused by ulcers.\\nThe decision to perform a barium enema is based on a\\nperson’s history of altered bowel habits. These can includediarrhea ,constipation , any lower abdominal pain they\\nare currently exhibiting, blood, mucus, or pus in theirstools. It is also recommended that this exam be used everyfive to 10 years to screen healthy people for colorectal can-cer, the second most deadly type of tumor in the UnitedStates.

As of 1997, some studies have shownthat the colonoscopy procedure performed by experi-\\nenced gastroenterologists is a more accurate initial diag-nostic tool for detecting early signs of colorectal cancer.A colonoscopy is the most accurate way for the physi-cian to examine the entire colon and rectum for polyps. Ifabnormalities are seen at this time the procedure isaccompanied by a biopsy. Some physicians use sigmoi-\\ndoscopy plus a barium enema instead of colonoscopy.\\nDescription\\nTo begin a barium enema, the patient will lie with\\ntheir back down on a tilting radiographic table in order tohave x rays of the abdomen taken. After being assisted toa different position, a well-lubricated rectal tube is insert-ed through the anus. This tube allows the physician orassistant to slowly administer the barium into the intes-tine. While this filling process is closely monitored, it isimportant for the patient to keep the anus tightly con-tracted against the rectal tube to help maintain its posi-tion and prevent the barium from leaking. This step isemphasized to the patient due to the inaccuracy that maybe caused if the barium leaks. A rectal balloon may alsobe inflated to help retain the barium. The table may betilted or the patient moved to a different position to aid inthe filling process.\\nAs the barium fills the intestine, x rays of the abdomen\\nare taken to distinguish significant findings.There are manyways to perform a barium enema. One way is that shortlyafter filling, the rectal tube is removed and the patientexpels as much of the barium as possible. Upon completingthis, an additional x ray is taken, and a double-contrast\\nenema may follow. If this is done immediately, a thinfilm of barium will remain in the intestine, and air isthen slowly injected to expand the bowel lumen.Sometimes no x rays will be taken until after the air isinjected.\\nPreparation\\nIn order to conduct the most accurate barium enema\\ntest, the patient must follow a prescribed diet and bowelpreparation instructions prior to the test. This preparationcommonly includes restricted intake of diary productsand a liquid diet for 24 hours prior to the test, in additionto drinking large amounts of water or clear liquids 12–24\\nhours before the test. Patients may also be given laxa-\\ntives , and asked to give themselves a cleansing enema.\\nIn addition to the prescribed diet and bowel prepara-\\ntion prior to the test, the patient can expect the followingduring a barium enema:\\n• They will be well draped with a gown as they are\\nsecured to a tilting x-ray table.\\n• As the barium or air is injected into the intestine, they\\nmay experience cramping pains or the urge to defecate.\\n• The patient will be instructed to take slow, deep breaths\\nthrough the mouth to ease any discomfort.\\nAftercare\\nPatients should follow several steps immediately\\nafter undergoing a barium enema, including:\\n• Drink plenty of fluids to help counteract the dehydrat-\\ning effects of bowel preparation and the test.\\n• Take time to rest. A barium enema and the bowel prepa-\\nration taken before it can be exhausting.\\n• A cleansing enema may be given to eliminate any\\nremaining barium. Lightly colored stools will be preva-lent for the next 24-72 hours following the test.\\nRisks\\nWhile a barium enema is considered a safe screen-\\ning test used on a routine basis, it can cause complica-tions in certain people. The following indications shouldbe kept in mind before a barium enema is performed:\\n• Those who have a rapid heart rate, severe ulcerative\\ncolitis , toxic megacolon, or a presumed perforation in\\nthe intestine should not undergo a barium enema.\\n• The test can be cautiously performed if the patient has a\\nblocked intestine, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis, orsevere bloody diarrhea.\\n• Complications that may be caused by the test include\\nperforation of the colon, water intoxication, bariumgranulomas (inflamed nodules), and allergic reaction.These are all very rare.\\nNormal results\\nWhen the patient undergoes a single-contrast enema,\\ntheir intestine is steadily filled with barium to differenti-ate the colon’s markings. A normal result displays uni-form filling of the colon. As the barium is expelled, theintestinal walls collapse. A normal result on the x rayafter defecation will show the intestinal lining as havinga standard, feathery appearance.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 448Barium enemaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 448'),\n",

The chronicform is identified by painful skin lesions .\\nDescription\\nThe acute form of the disease gets its name from an\\noutbreak that occurred in 1871 near La Oroya, Peru.KEY TERMS\\nAcute —Referring to the course of a disease, or a\\nphase of a disease, the short-term experience ofprominent symptoms.\\nChronic —Referring to the course of a disease, or a\\nphase of a disease, the long-term experience ofprominent symptoms.\\nErythrocytes —Red blood cells.\\nHemolytic anemia —A form of erythrocyte deficien-\\ncy caused by the destruction of the red blood cells.\\nHost —The organism that harbors or nourishes\\nanother organism (parasite). In bartonellosis, theperson infected with Bartonella basilliformis .\\nVector —An organism, such as insects or rodents,\\nthat can transmit disease to humans.\\nMore than 7,000 people perished. Some survivors later\\ndeveloped a skin disease, called verruga peruana (Peru-vian warts ). These skin lesions were observed prior to\\nthe 1871 outbreak—perhaps as far back as the pre-Columbian era—but a connection to Oroya fever wasunknown. In 1885, a young medical researcher, DanielCarrion, inoculated himself with blood from a lesion tostudy the course of the skin disease. When he became illwith Oroya fever, the connection became apparent.Oroya fever is often called Carrion’s disease in honor ofhis fatal experiment.\\nThe bacteria, Bartonella bacilliformis , was isolated\\nby Alberto Barton in 1909, but wasn’t identified as thecause of the fever until 1940. The Bartonella genus\\nincludes at least 11 bacteria species, four of which causehuman diseases, including cat-scratch disease and\\nbacillary angiomatosis . However, bartonellosis refers\\nexclusively to the disease caused by B. bacilliformis . The\\ndisease is limited to a small area of the Andes Mountainsin western South America; nearly all cases have been inPeru, Colombia, and Ecuador. A large outbreak involvingthousands of people occurred in 1940–41, but bartonel-losis has since occurred sporadically. Control of sand-flies, the only known disease carrier (vector), has beencredited with managing the disease.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBartonellosis is transmitted by the nocturnal sandfly\\nand arises from infection with B. bacilliformis .

The anemia is accompanied by high fever, muscleand joint pain ,delirium , and possibly coma .\\nTwo to eight weeks after the acute phase, an infected\\nindividual develops verruga peruana. However, individu-als may exhibit the characteristic lesions without everexperiencing the acute phase. Left untreated, the lesionsmay last months or years. These lesions resemble blood-filled blisters, up to 1.6 in (4 cm) in diameter, and appearprimarily on the head and limbs. They can be painful tothe touch and may bleed or ulcerate.\\nDiagnosis\\nBartonellosis is identified by symptoms and the\\npatient’s history, such as recent travel in areas where bar-tonellosis occurs.

Alternative terms include: shakenbaby; shaken baby syndrome ; child abuse ; and non-\\naccidental trauma (NAT).\\nDescription\\nInternal injuries, cuts, burns ,bruises and broken or\\nfractured bones are all possible signs of battered childsyndrome. Emotional damage to a child is also often theby-product of child abuse, which can result in seriousbehavioral problems such as substance abuse or thephysical abuse of others. Approximately 14% of childrenin the United States are physically abused each year, andan estimated 2,000 of those children die as a result of theabuse. Between 1994–1995, 1.1 million cases of childabuse were recorded in the United States; of that number,55% of the victims were less than a year old.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBattered child syndrome (BCS) is found at every\\nlevel of society, although the incidence may be higher inlow-income households where adult caregivers suffergreater stress and social difficulties, without having had\\nthe benefit of higher education.

Symptoms may include\\na delayed visit to the emergency room with an injuredchild; an implausible explanation of the cause of a child’sinjury; bruises that match the shape of a hand, fist or belt;cigarette burns; scald marks; bite marks; black eyes;unconsciousness; bruises around the neck; and a bulgingfontanel in infants.\\nDiagnosis\\nBattered child syndrome is most often diagnosed by\\nan emergency room physician or pediatrician, or byteachers or social workers. Physical examination will\\ndetect bruises, burns, swelling, retinal hemorrhages. Xrays, and other imaging techniques, such as MRI or scansmay confirm fractures or other internal injuries. The\\npresence of injuries at different stages of healing (i.e.having occurred at different times)is nearly alwaysindicative of BCS. Establishing the diagnosis is oftenhindered by the excessive cautiousness of caregivers orby actual concealment of the true origin of the child˛sinjuries, as a result of fear, shame and avoidance ordenial mechanisms.\\nTreatment\\nMedical treatment for battered child syndrome will\\nvary according to the type of injury incurred. Counselingand the implementation of an intervention plan for thechild’s parents or guardians is necessary. The child abusermay be incarcerated, and/or the abused child removedfrom the home to prevent further harm. Reporting childabuse to authorities is mandatory for doctors, teachers,and childcare workers in most states as a way to preventcontinued abuse. Both physical and psychological therapyare often recommended as treatment for the abused child.\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for battered child syndrome will\\ndepend on the severity of injury, actions taken by theauthorities to ensure the future safety of the injured child,and the willingness of parents or guardians to seek coun-seling for themselves as well as for the child.\\nPrevention\\nRecognizing the potential for child abuse in a situa-\\ntion, and the seeking or offering of intervention andcounseling before battered child syndrome occurs is thebest way to prevent it.

Although most childrenbetween the ages of three and five begin to stay dry atnight, the age at which children are physically and emo-tionally ready to maintain complete bladder controlvaries. Enuresis is a technical term that refers to the con-tinued, usually involuntary, passage of urine during thenight or the day after the age at which control is expected.\\nDescription\\nMost children wet the bed occasionally, and defini-\\ntions of the age and frequency at which bed-wettingbecomes a medical problem vary somewhat. Manyresearchers consider bed-wetting normal until age 6.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 453Bed-wettingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 453'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 467}, page_content='About 10% of 6-year-old children wet the bed about\\nonce a month. More boys than girls have this problem.The American Psychiatric Association, however, definesenuresis as repeated voiding of urine into the bed orclothes at age five or older. The wetting is usually invol-untary but in some cases it is intentional. For a diagnosisof enuresis, wetting must occur twice a week for at leastthree months with no underlying physiological cause.Enuresis, both nighttime (nocturnal) and daytime (diur-nal), at age five affects 7% of boys and 3% of girls. Byage 10, it affects 3% of boys and 2% of girls; only 1% ofadolescents experience enuresis.\\nEnuresis is divided into two classes. A child with\\nprimary enuresis has never established bladder control. Achild with secondary enuresis begins to wet after a pro-longed dry period. Some children have both nocturnaland diurnal enuresis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe causes of bed-wetting are not entirely known. It\\ntends to run in families. Most children with primary enure-sis have a close relative—a parent, aunt, or uncle—whoalso had the disorder. About 70% of children with two par-ents who wet the bed will also wet the bed. Twin studieshave shown that both of a pair of identical twins experienceenuresis more often than both of a pair of fraternal twins.\\nSometimes bed-wetting can be caused by a serious\\nmedical problem like diabetes, sickle-cell anemia, orepilepsy. Snoring and episodes of interrupted breathing\\nduring sleep ( sleep apnea ) occasionally contribute to\\nbed-wetting problems. Enlarged adenoids can causethese conditions. Other physiological problems, such asurinary tract infection, severe constipation , or spinal\\ncord injury , can cause bed-wetting.\\nChildren who wet the bed frequently may have a\\nsmaller than normal functional bladder capacity. Func-tional bladder capacity is the amount of urine a personcan hold in the bladder before feeling a strong urge tourinate. When functional capacity is small, the bladderwill not hold all the urine produced during the night.Tests have shown that bladder size in these children isnormal. Nevertheless, they experience frequent strongurges to urinate. Such children urinate often during thedaytime and may wet several times at night. Although asmall functional bladder capacity may be caused by adevelopmental delay, it may also be that the child’s habitof voiding frequently slows bladder development.\\nParents often report that their bed-wetting child is an\\nextremely sound sleeper and difficult to wake. However,several research studies found that bed-wetting childrenhave normal sleep patterns and that bed-wetting canoccur in any stage of sleep.Recent medical research has found that many chil-\\ndren who wet the bed may have a deficiency of an impor-tant hormone known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH).ADH helps to concentrate urine during sleep hours,meaning that the urine contains less water and thereforetakes up less space. This decreased volume of water usu-ally prevents the child’s bladder from overfilling duringthe night, unless the child drank a lot just before going tobed. Testing of many bed-wetting children has shownthat these children do not have the usual increase in ADHduring sleep. Children who wet the bed, therefore, oftenproduce more urine during the hours of sleep than theirbladders can hold. If they do not wake up, the bladderreleases the excess urine and the child wets the bed.\\nResearch demonstrates that in most cases bed-wet-\\nting does not indicate that the child has a physical or psy-chological problem. Children who wet the bed usuallyhave normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns thatare no different from those of non-bed-wetting children.Sometimes emotional stress , such as the birth of a sib-\\nling, a death in the family, or separation from the family,\\nmay be associated with the onset of bed-wetting in a pre-viously toilet-trained child. Daytime wetting, however,may indicate that the problem has a physical cause.\\nWhile most children have no long-term problems as\\na result of bed-wetting, some children may develop psy-chological problems. Low self-esteem may occur whenthese children, who already feel embarrassed, are furtherhumiliated by angry or frustrated parents who punishthem or who are overly aggressive about toilet training.The problem can by aggravated when playmates tease orwhen social activities such as sleep-away camp areavoided for fear of teasing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a child continues to wet the bed after the age of\\nsix, parents may feel the need to seek evaluation anddiagnosis by the family doctor or a children’s specialist(pediatrician). Typically, before the doctor can make adiagnosis, a thorough medical history is obtained. Thenthe child receives a physical examination , appropriate\\nlaboratory tests, including a urine test ( urinalysis ), and,\\nif necessary, radiologic studies (such as x rays).\\nIf the child is healthy and no physical problem is found,\\nwhich is the case 90% of the time, the doctor may not rec-ommend treatment but rather may provide the parents andthe child with reassurance, information, and advice.\\nTreatment\\nOccasionally a doctor will determine that the prob-\\nlem is serious enough to require treatment.

       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 468}, page_content='treatments for bed-wetting include bladder training\\nexercises, motivational therapy, drug therapy, psy-chotherapy, and diet therapy.\\nBladder training exercises are based on the theory\\nthat those who wet the bed have small functional bladdercapacity. Children are told to drink a large quantity ofwater and to try to prolong the periods between urina-tions. These exercises are designed to increase bladdercapacity but are only successful in resolving bed-wettingin a small number of patients.\\nIn motivational therapy, parents attempt to encour-\\nage the child to combat bed-wetting, but the child mustwant to achieve success. Positive reinforcement, such aspraise or rewards for staying dry, can help improve self-image and resolve the condition. Punishment for “wet”nights will hamper the child’s self-esteem and compoundthe problem.\\nThe following motivational techniques are common-\\nly used:\\n• Behavior modification. This method of therapy is\\naimed at helping children take responsibility for theirnighttime bladder control by teaching new behaviors.For example, children are taught to use the bathroombefore bedtime and to avoid drinking fluids after din-ner. While behavior modification generally producesgood results, it is long-term treatment.\\n• Alarms. This form of therapy uses a sensor placed in\\nthe child’s pajamas or in a bed pad. This sensor triggersan alarm that wakes the child at the first sign of wet-ness. If the child is awakened, he or she can then go tothe bathroom and finish urinating. The intention is tocondition a response to awaken when the bladder isfull. Bed-wetting alarms require the motivation of bothparents and children. They are considered the mosteffective form of treatment now available.\\nA number of drugs are also used to treat bed-wetting.\\nThese medications are usually fast acting; children oftenrespond to them within the first week of treatment. Amongthe drugs commonly used are a nasal spray of desmo-pressin acetate (DDA VP), a substance similar to the hor-mone that helps regulate urine production; and imipraminehydrochloride, a drug that helps to increase bladder capac-ity. Studies show that imipramine is effective for as manyas 50% of patients. However, children often wet the bedagain after the drug is discontinued, and it has some sideeffects. Some bed-wetting with an underlying physicalcause can be treated by surgical procedures. These causesinclude enlarged adenoids that cause sleep apnea, physicaldefects in the urinary system, or a spinal tumor.\\nPsychotherapy is indicated when the child exhibits\\nsigns of severe emotional distress in response to eventssuch as a death in the family, the birth of a new child, a\\nchange in schools, or divorce. Psychotherapy is also indi-cated if a child shows signs of persistently low self-esteem or depression.\\nIn rare cases, allergies or intolerances to certain\\nfoods—such as dairy products, citrus products, or choco-late—can cause bed-wetting. When children have foodsensitivities, bed-wetting may be helped by discoveringthe substances that trigger the allergic response and elim-inating these substances from the child’s diet.\\nAlternative treatment\\nA number of alternative treatments are available for\\nbed-wetting.\\nMassage\\nAccording to practitioners of this technique, pres-\\nsure applied to various points on the body may help alle-viate the condition. Acupressure or massage, when done\\nby a trained therapist, may also be helpful in bed-wettingcaused by a neurologic problem.\\nHerbal and homeopathic remedies\\nSome herbal remedies, such as horsetail ( Equisetum\\narvense ) have also been used to treat bed-wetting. A\\ntrained homeopathic practitioner, working at the consti-tutional level, will seek to rebalance the child’s vitalforce, eliminating the imbalanced behavior of bed-wet-ting. Common homeopathic remedies used in this treat-ment include Causticum, Lycopodium, and Pulsatilla.\\nHypnosis\\nHypnosis is another approach that is being used suc-\\ncessfully by practitioners trained in this therapy. It trainsthe child to awaken and go to the bathroom when his orher bladder feels full. Hypnosis is less expensive, lesstime-consuming, and less dangerous than mostapproaches; it has virtually no side effects. Recent med-ical studies show that hypnotherapy can work quickly—\\nwithin four to six sessions.\\nPrognosis\\nOccasional bed-wetting is not a disease and it does\\nnot have a “cure.” If the child has no underlying physicalor psychological problem that is causing the bed-wetting,in most cases he or she will outgrow the condition with-out treatment. About 15% of bedwetters become dry eachyear after age 6.

These steps include:\\n• Encouraging and praising the child for staying dry\\ninstead of punishing when the child wets.\\n• Reminding the child to urinate before going to bed, if\\nhe or she feels the need.\\n• Limiting liquid intake at least two hours before bed-\\ntime.KEY TERMS\\nAcupressure —A technique using pressure to vari-\\nous points on the body to alleviate health prob-lems.\\nADH —Antidiuretic hormone, or the hormone that\\nhelps to concentrate urine during the night.\\nBehavior modification —Techniques used to change\\nharmful behavior patterns.\\nBladder —The muscular sac or container that\\nstores urine until it is released from the bodythrough the tube that carries urine from the blad-der to the outside of the body (urethra).\\nDDAVP —Desmopressin acetate, a drug used to\\nregulate urine production.\\nHypnosis —The technique by which a trained pro-\\nfessional relaxes the subject and then asks ques-tions or gives suggestions.\\nImipramine hydrochloride —A drug used to\\nincrease bladder capacity.\\nKidneys —A pair of organs located on each side of\\nthe spine in the lower back area.

The temperaturesshould be extreme (hot hot and ice cold), yet tolerable to\\nthe skin. Hot compresses should be applied for threeminutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold compress appli-cation, repeating the cycle three times. The cycle shouldalways end with the cold compress.\\nPrevention\\nIt is usually possible to prevent bedsores from devel-\\noping or worsening. The patient should be inspected reg-ularly; should bathe or shower every day, using warmwater and mild soap; and should avoid cold or dry air. Abedridden patient should be repositioned at least onceevery two hours while awake. A person who uses awheelchair should shift his weight every 10 or 15 min-utes, or be helped to reposition himself at least once anhour.

These symptoms include ulcerationof the mouth or the genital area, skin lesions , and inflam-\\nmation of the uvea (an area around the pupil of the eye).\\nDescription\\nBehcet’s syndrome is a chronic disease that involves\\nmultiple body systems. The disease is named for a Turk-ish dermatologist, Hulusi Behcet, who first reported apatient with recurrent mouth and genital ulcers alongwith uveitis in 1937. The disease occurs worldwide, but\\nis most prevalent in Japan, the Middle East, and in theMediterranean region. There is a wider prevalenceamong males than females in a ratio of two to one.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of Behcet’s syndrome is unknown. Symp-\\ntoms include recurring ulcers in the mouth or the genitalarea, skin lesions, arthritis that affects mainly the kneesand ankles, pain and irritation in the eyes, and fever . The\\nmouth and genital ulcers tend to occur in multiples andcan be quite painful. In the mouth, these ulcers are gener-ally found on the tongue, gums, and the inside of the lipsor jaws. In the genital area, the ulcers usually occur onthe penis and scrotum in males and on the vulva ofwomen. The eye inflammation can lead to blindness.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause Behcet’s syndrome is a multisystem disease,\\nit is difficult to diagnose. International criteria have beenproposed to assist in classifying this disease. There is noone diagnostic feature of this disease, so diagnosis dependson grouping together enough symptoms in order to identifythe disease. Symptoms of Behcet’s syndrome also occur inother diseases, so it is often necessary to rule out the otherdiseases before a definitive diagnosis can be reached.\\nTreatment\\nSome of the current drugs used to treat Behcet’s syn-\\ndrome include:\\n• corticosteroids\\n• cyclosporin\\n• azathioprine\\n• chlorambucil• interferon alpha• thalidomide• levamisole• pulse cyclophosphamide• cyclosporine\\nPrognosis\\nThe prognosis for Behcet’s syndrome is generally\\npoor.

Afflict-\\ned individuals may be unable to close the eye on theaffected side of the face, and may also experience tear-ing, drooling, and hypersensitive hearing. The onset canbe quite sudden, sometimes occurring overnight.Although Bell’s palsy is unsettling and inconvenient, it istypically not indicative of a serious health problem. Theweakness and paralysis resolve completely in the majori-ty of cases.\\nDescription\\nBell’s palsy has been described as a diagnosis of\\nexclusion because several other disorders present similarKEY TERMS\\nEndemic disease —An infectious disease that\\noccurs frequently in a specific geographicallocale.

The lymph nodes con-tain organisms that destroy bacteria and other dis-ease causing organisms (also called pathogens).\\nSyphilis— This disease occurs in two forms. One is\\na sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacte-ria. The second form is not sexually transmitted,but passed on by direct contact with the patient orthrough use of shared food dishes and utensils.symptoms. Facial palsies have been linked to conditions\\nsuch as Lyme disease , ear infection, meningitis ,\\nsyphilis , German measles (rubella ),mumps ,chicken-\\npox (varicella), and infection with Epstein-Barr virus\\n(e.g., infectious mononucleosis ). True Bell’s palsy is an\\nidiopathic facial palsy, meaning the root cause cannot beidentified. Although Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, itcan present symptoms similar to truly serious conditions,such as a stroke , ruptured aneurysm, or tumors.\\nEvery year, approximately 40,000-65,000 Americans\\nare stricken with Bell’s palsy. Worldwide, there is anannual incidence of 20-30 cases per 100,000 individuals.An individual can be affected at any age, but young andmiddle-aged adults are the most likely to be affected. It isunusual to see Bell’s palsy in people less than 10 yearsold. Bell’s palsy can affect either side of the face, and nei-ther gender seems to be at a greater risk. Pregnant womenand individuals with diabetes, influenza , a cold, or an\\nupper respiratory infection seem to be at a greater risk.Although it cannot be considered a serious condition froma health standpoint, it can cause extreme stress , embar-\\nrassment, and inconvenience for those affected.\\nIn the large majority of cases (80-85%), the facial\\nweakness or paralysis is temporary. However, individualswho experience complete paralysis seem to have a poorerrecovery rate with only 60% returning to normal. Approx-imately 4-6% of all Bell’s palsy cases result in permanentfacial deformity, and another 10-15% experience perma-nent problems with spasms, twitching, or contracted mus-cles. Between 2% and 7.3% of individuals who haveexperienced Bell’s palsy will have a recurrence. On aver-age, the first recurrence happens 9.8 years after the firstepisode; the second, 6.7 years later. One recurrence isvery infrequent, and a second is extremely rare.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe symptoms of Bell’s palsy arise from an inflam-\\nmation or swelling of the seventh cranial nerve, other-wise called the facial nerve. Both sides of the face have afacial nerve which controls the muscles on that side ofthe face. The course of the facial nerve passes through abony canal in the skull. When the nerve becomesswollen, it is compressed since the canal does not allowfor any expansion. As further swelling increases the com-pression, nerve signal conduction is impeded or evenprevented. The interference with the nerve signals is seenin the loss of muscle control and tone.\\nWhy the facial nerve becomes inflamed in Bell’s\\npalsy is a matter of some debate, and medical researchersand doctors are not in complete agreement. The best-sup-ported evidence implicates the herpes simplex virus(HSV), which is responsible for cold sores and fever\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 461Bell’s palsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 461'),\n",

Most people harbor this virus,although they may not exhibit symptoms.\\nThe major symptom of Bell’s palsy is one-sided\\nfacial weakness or paralysis. Muscle control is eitherinadequate or completely missing. There may also beinvoluntary facial movements, such as twitches, thataccompany certain facial expressions. Afflicted individu-als frequently have difficulty shutting the affected eyeand may not be able to close it at all.\\nDiagnosis\\nAlthough Bell’s palsy is not life-threatening, it\\nshares symptoms in common with serious conditions,such as stroke. Therefore, emergency medical attention isa wise and necessary precaution. Bell’s palsy affects thefacial nerve, unlike most strokes associated with facialweakness which affect higher nerve centers ultimatelysupplying the facial nerve. These two disorders can bedistinquished clinically because most strokes do notcause weakness of the forehead or eyelid muscles.\\nThe fact that Bell’s palsy is a diagnosis of exclusion\\nbecomes apparent in the course of the medical examina-tion—the usual mode of examination is to rule out other\\ndisorders until only Bell’s palsy is left. Disorders thatneed to be excluded include demyelinating disease (e.g.,multiple sclerosis ), stroke, tumors, bacterial or viral\\ninfection, and bone fracture.\\nDuring the physical examination , the afflicted indi-\\nvidual is asked about recent illnesses, accidents, infec-tions, and any other symptoms. A visual exam of theears, throat, and sinus is done, and hearing is tested. Theextent of the symptoms is assessed by grading the sym-metry of the face at rest and during voluntary move-ments, such as wrinkling the forehead, puckering thelips, and closing the affected eye. Involuntary move-ments are assessed in combination with the voluntarymovements. Neurologic exam is done to rule out\\ninvolvement of other parts of the nervous system exceptfor the facial muscles, which would exclude the diagno-sis of Bell’s palsy.\\nIn response to the individual’s medical history,\\nblood tests and possibly a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\\nanalysis are ordered. The results of these tests help\\ndetermine the presence of a bacterial or viral infection oran inflammatory disease. Electrophysiological tests, inwhich a muscle or nerve is artificially stimulated, may beused to assess the condition of facial muscles and thefacial nerve. Common tests include electromyography ,\\nwhich measures voluntary muscle movement, and nerveconduction velocity, which determines the extent ofnerve degeneration. Radiological tests may also beincluded, such as an x ray, as well as imaging tests, suchas magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed\\ntomography. These tests—especially MRI—allow anexcellent view of the nerve itself.\\nOnce all other possibilities are exhausted, a diagno-\\nsis of Bell’s palsy is made. The following weeks are aperiod of watchful waiting. Further examinations aredone to track recovery. Results from nerve conductiontests may be used to predict an outcome. However, thisuse is questioned by some doctors and medicalresearchers since evidence for their predictive value isinconclusive.\\nIf facial movement, even a small amount, has not\\nreturned within 3-4 months, the diagnosis of Bell’s palsymay need to be reevaluated.\\nTreatment\\nMany doctors prescribe an antiviral and/or a steroid\\nfor Bell’s palsy, but there is some controversy aboutwhether these drugs actually help.

Antiviral drugs , such as\\nacyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir, are prescribed todestroy actively replicating viruses and prevent furtherdamage to the facial nerve. Steroids, such as prednisone,are thought to be useful in reducing swelling and, there-fore, compression on the nerve.\\nIn the past, surgery was performed to relieve the\\ncompression on the nerve. However, this treatmentoption is now used very infrequently because it does notguarantee recovery, and it carries the risk of permanentnerve damage.\\nThe need to protect the affected eye is universally\\npromoted. Since the individual may not be able to lowerthe affected eyelid, the eye may become dry, particularlyat night. Excessive dryness can damage the cornea. Day-time treatment includes artificial tears and may includean eye patch or other protective measures. Nighttimetreatment involves a more intense effort at keeping theeye protected.

The Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test shouldbe administered and interpreted by a trained psychologistor psychiatrist. The Bender-Gestalt should always beemployed as only one element of a complete battery ofpsychological or developmental tests, and should neverbe used alone as the sole basis for a diagnosis.\\nDescription\\nThe original Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test was\\ndeveloped in 1938 by psychiatrist Lauretta Bender. Thereare several different versions of the Bender-Gestalt avail-able today (i.e., the Bender-Gestalt test; Modified Ver-sion of the Bender-Gestalt test for Preschool and PrimarySchool Children; the Hutt Adaptation of the Bender-Gestalt test; the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test forChildren; the Bender-Gestalt test for Young Children; theWatkins Bender-Gestalt Scoring System; the CanterBackground Interference Procedure for the Bender-Gestalt test). All use the same basic test materials, butvary in their scoring and interpretation methods.\\nThe standard Bender Visual Motor Gestalt test con-\\nsists of nine figures, each on its own 3 /H110035 card. An\\nexaminer presents each figure to the test subject one at atime and asks the subject to copy it onto a single piece ofblank paper. The only instruction given to the subject isthat he or she should make the best reproduction of thefigure possible. The test is not timed, although standardadministration time is typically 10-20 minutes. Aftertesting is complete, the results are scored based on accu-racy and organization.

For these people,benzodiazepines can help bring their feelings under con-trol. The medicine can also relieve troubling symptomsof anxiety, such as pounding heartbeat, breathing prob-lems, irritability, nausea, and faintness.\\nPhysicians may sometimes prescribe these drugs for\\nother conditions, such as muscle spasms, epilepsy andother seizure disorders, phobias ,panic disorder , with-\\ndrawal from alcohol, and sleeping problems. However,this medicine should not be used every day for sleepproblems that last more than a few days. If used this way,the drug loses its effectiveness within a few weeks.\\nBenzodiazepines should not be used to relieve the\\nnervousness and tension of normal everyday life.\\nDescription\\nThe family of antianxiety drugs known as benzodi-\\nazepines includes alprazolam (Xanax), chlordiazepoxide(Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan).These medicines take effect fairly quickly, starting to workwithin an hour after they are taken. Benzodiazepines areavailable only with a physician’s prescription and areavailable in tablet, capsule, liquid, or injectable forms.\\nRecommended dosage\\nThe recommended dosage depends on the type of\\nbenzodiazepine, its strength, and the condition for whichit is being taken. Doses may be different for differentpeople. Check with the physician who prescribed thedrug or the pharmacist who filled the prescription for thecorrect dosage.\\nAlways take benzodiazepines exactly as directed.\\nNever take larger or more frequent doses, and do not takethe drug for longer than directed. If the medicine does notseem to be working, check with the physician who pre-scribed it. Do not increase the dose or stop taking the\\nmedicine unless the physician says to do so. Stopping the\\ndrug suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms, espe-cially if it has been taken in large doses or over a longperiod. People who are taking the medicine for seizuredisorders may have seizures if they stop taking it sudden-ly. If it is necessary to stop taking the medicine, checkwith a physician for directions on how to stop. The physi-cian may recommend tapering down gradually to reducethe chance of withdrawal symptoms or other problems.\\nPrecautions\\nSeeing a physician regularly while taking benzodi-\\nazepines is important, especially during the first fewmonths of treatment. The physician will check to makesure the medicine is working as it should and will noteunwanted side effects.\\nPeople who take benzodiazepines to relieve nervous-\\nness, tension, or symptoms of panic disorder shouldcheck with their physicians every two to three months tomake sure they still need to keep taking the medicine.\\nPatients who are taking benzodiazepines for sleep\\nproblems should check with their physicians if they arenot sleeping better within 7-10 days. Sleep problems thatlast longer than this may be a sign of another medicalproblem.\\nPeople who take this medicine to help them sleep\\nmay have trouble sleeping when they stop taking themedicine. This effect should last only a few nights.\\nSome people, especially older people, feel drowsy,\\ndizzy, lightheaded, or less alert when using benzodi-azepines. The drugs may also cause clumsiness orunsteadiness. When the medicine is taken at bedtime,these effects may even occur the next morning. Anyonewho takes these drugs should not drive, use machines ordo anything else that might be dangerous until they havefound out how the drugs affect them.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 466BenzodiazepinesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 466'),\n",

Beriberi literally means “I can’t, I can’t” in Sing-halese, which reflects the crippling effect it has on itsvictims. It is common in parts of southeast Asia, wherewhite rice is the main food. In the United States, beriberiis primarily seen in people with chronic alcoholism .\\nDescription\\nBeriberi puzzled medical experts for years as it rav-\\naged people of all ages in Asia. Doctors thought it wascaused by something in food. Not until the early 1900sdid scientists discover that rice bran, the outer coveringthat was removed to create the polished white rice pre-ferred by Asians, actually contained something that pre-vented the disease. Thiamine was the first vitamin identi-fied. In the 1920s, extracts of rice polishings were usedto treat the disease.\\nIn adults, there are different forms of beriberi, classi-\\nfied according to the body systems most affected. Dryberiberi involves the nervous system; wet beriberi affectsthe heart and circulation. Both types usually occur in thesame patient, with one set of symptoms predominating.\\nA less common form of cardiovascular, or wet\\nberiberi, is known as “shoshin.” This condition involves arapid appearance of symptoms and acute heart failure . It\\nis highly fatal and is known to cause sudden death in\\nyoung migrant laborers in Asia whose diet consists ofwhite rice.\\nCerebral beriberi, also known as Wernicke-Korsakoff\\nsyndrome, usually occurs in chronic alcoholics and affectsthe central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It canbe caused by a situation that aggravates a chronic thiaminedeficiency, like an alcoholic binge or severe vomiting.\\nInfantile beriberi is seen in breastfed infants of thi-\\namine-deficient mothers, who live in developing nations.\\nAlthough severe beriberi is uncommon in the United\\nStates, less severe thiamine deficiencies do occur. About25% of all alcoholics admitted to a hospital in the UnitedStates show some evidence of thiamine deficiency.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThiamine is one of the B vitamins and plays an\\nimportant role in energy metabolism and tissue building.It combines with phosphate to form the coenzyme thi-\\namine pyrophosphate (TPP), which is essential in reac-\\ntions that produce energy from glucose or that convertglucose to fat for storage in the tissues. When there is notenough thiamine in the diet, these basic energy functionsare disturbed, leading to problems throughout the body.\\nSpecial situations, such as an over-active metabo-\\nlism, prolonged fever ,pregnancy , and breastfeeding,\\ncan increase the body’s thiamine requirements and leadto symptoms of deficiency. Extended periods of diar-\\nrhea or chronic liver disease can result in the body’s\\ninability to maintain normal levels of many nutrients,including thiamine. Other persons at risk are patientswith kidney failure on dialysis and those with severedigestive problems who are unable to absorb nutrients.Alcoholics are susceptible because they may substitutealcohol for food and their frequent intake of alcoholdecreases the body’s ability to absorb thiamine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 469BeriberiGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 469'),\n",

When the cells of the smooth\\nmuscles in the digestive system and glands do not getenough energy from glucose, they are unable to pro-duce more glucose from the normal digestion of food.There is a loss of appetite, indigestion , severe consti-\\npation , and a lack of hydrochloric acid in the stomach.\\n• Nervous System. Glucose is essential for the central\\nnervous system to function normally. Early deficiencysymptoms are fatigue , irritability, and poor memory. If\\nthe deficiency continues, there is damage to the periph-eral nerves that causes loss of sensation and muscleweakness, which is called peripheral neuropathy . The\\nlegs are most affected. The toes feel numb and the feethave a burning sensation; the leg muscles become soreand the calf muscles cramp. The individual walksunsteadily and has difficulty getting up from a squattingposition. Eventually, the muscles shrink (atrophy) andthere is a loss of reflexes in the knees and feet; the feetmay hang limp (footdrop).\\n• Cardiovascular system. There is a rapid heartbeat and\\nsweating. Eventually the heart muscle weakens.Because the smooth muscle in the blood vessels isaffected, the arteries and veins relax, causing swelling,known as edema , in the legs.\\n• Musculoskeletal system. There is widespread muscle\\npain caused by the lack of TPP in the muscle tissue.\\nInfants who are breastfed by a thiamine-deficient mother\\nusually develop symptoms of deficiency between thesecond and fourth month of life. They are pale, restless,unable to sleep, prone to diarrhea, and have musclewasting and edema in their arms and legs. They have acharacteristic, sometimes silent, cry and develop heartfailure and nerve damage.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physical examination will reveal many of the\\nearly symptoms of beriberi, such as fatigue, irritation,nausea, constipation, and poor memory, but the deficien-cy may be difficult to identify. Information about theindividual’s diet and general health is also needed.\\nThere are many biochemical tests based on thiamine\\nmetabolism or the functions of TPP that can detect a thi-amine deficiency. Levels of thiamine can be measured inthe blood and urine and will be reduced if there is a defi-ciency. The urine can be collected for 24 hours to mea-sure the level of thiamine excreted. Another reliable testmeasures the effect of TPP on red blood cell activitysince all forms of beriberi affect the metabolism of redblood cells.An electroencephalogram (EEG), which measures\\nelectrical activity in the brain, may be done to rule outother causes of neurologic changes. Observing improve-ments in the patient after giving thiamine supplementswill also confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment with thiamine reverses the deficiency in\\nthe body and relieves most of the symptoms. Severe thi-amine deficiency is treated with high doses of thiaminegiven by injection into a muscle (intramuscular) or in asolution that goes into a vein (intravenously) for severaldays. Then smaller doses can be given either by injectionor in pill form until the patient recovers. Usually thereare other deficiencies in the B vitamins that will alsoneed treatment.\\nThe cardiovascular symptoms of wet beriberi can\\nrespond to treatment within a few hours if they are nottoo severe. Heart failure may require additional treatmentwith diuretics that help eliminate excess fluid and with\\nheart-strengthening drugs like digitalis.\\nRecovery from peripheral neuropathy and other\\nsymptoms of dry beriberi may take longer and patientsfrequently become discouraged. They should stay active;physical therapy will also help in recovery.\\nInfantile beriberi is treated by giving thiamine to\\nboth the infant and the breast feeding mother until levelsare normal.\\nIn Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, thiamine should\\nbe given intravenously or by injection at first because theintestinal absorption of thiamine is probably impairedand the patient is very ill. Most of the symptoms will berelieved by treatment, though there may be residualmemory loss.\\nExcess thiamine is excreted by the body in the urine,\\nand negative reactions to too much thiamine are rare.Thiamine is unstable in alkali solutions, so it should notbe taken with antacids or barbiturates .\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments for beriberi deal first with\\ncorrecting the thiamine deficiency. As in conventionaltreatments, alternative treatments for beriberi stress a\\ndiet rich in foods that provide thiamine and other B vita-mins, such as brown rice, whole grains, raw fruits andvegetables, legumes, seeds, nuts, and yogurt. Drinkingmore than one glass of liquid with a meal should beavoided, since this may wash out the vitamins beforethey can be absorbed by the body.

Additional supplements of B vitamins, a\\nmultivitamin and mineral complex, and Vitamin C arealso recommended. Other alternative therapies may helprelieve the person’s symptoms after the thiamine defi-ciency is corrected.\\nPrognosis\\nBeriberi is fatal if not treated and the longer the defi-\\nciency exists, the sicker the person becomes. Most of thesymptoms can be reversed and full recovery is possiblewhen thiamine levels are returned to normal and main-tained with a balanced diet and vitamin supplements asneeded.\\nPrevention\\nA balanced diet containing all essential nutrients\\nwill prevent a thiamine deficiency and the developmentof beriberi. People who consume large quantities of junkfood like soda, pretzels, chips, candy, and high carbohy-drate foods made with unenriched flours may be defi-cient in thiamine and other vital nutrients. They mayneed to take vitamin supplements and should improvetheir diets .\\nDietary Requirements\\nThe body’s requirements for thiamine are tied to car-\\nbohydrate metabolism and expressed in terms of totalintake of calories. The current recommended dietaryallowances (RDA) are 0.5 mg for every 1,000 calories,with a minimum daily intake of 1 mg even for those whoeat fewer than 2,000 calories in a day. The RDA for chil-dren and teenagers is the same as for adults: 1.4 mg dailyfor males over age eleven, and 1.1 mg for females. Dur-ing pregnancy, an increase to 1.5 mg daily is needed.Because of increased energy needs and the secretion ofthiamine in breast milk, breast feeding mothers need 1.5mg every day. In infants, 0.4 mg is advised.\\nFood Sources\\nThe best food sources of thiamine are lean pork,\\nbeef, liver, brewer’s yeast, peas and beans, whole orenriched grains, and breads. The more refined the food,as in white rice, white breads, and some cereals, thelower the thiamine. Many food products are enrichedwith thiamine, along with riboflavin, niacin, and iron, toprevent dietary deficiency.\\nDuring the milling process, rice is polished and all the\\nvitamins in the exterior coating of bran are lost. Boiling therice before husking preserves the vitamins by distributingthem throughout the kernel.

Berylliosis occurs in both acute and chronicforms. In some cases, appearance of the disease may bedelayed as much as 20 years after exposure to beryllium.\\nDescription\\nIn the 1930s, scientists discovered that beryllium\\ncould make fluorescent light bulbs last longer. During thefollowing decade, the hard, grayish metal was identifiedas the cause of a potentially debilitating, sometimesdeadly disease characterized by shortness of breath and\\ninflammation, swelling, and scarring of the lungs.\\nThe manufacture of fluorescent light bulbs is no\\nlonger a source of beryllium exposure, but serious healthhazards are associated with any work environment orprocess in which beryllium fumes or particles becomeairborne. Working with pure beryllium, beryllium com-pounds (e.g. beryllium oxide), or beryllium alloys causesoccupational exposure. So do jobs involving:\\n• electronics\\n• fiber optics\\n• manufacturing ceramics, bicycle frames, golf clubs,\\nmirrors, and microwave ovens\\n• mining• nuclear weapons and reactors• reclaiming scrap metal\\n• space and atomic engineering.\\n• dental and laboratory technology\\nBeryllium dust and fumes are classified as toxic air\\npollutants by the Environmental Protection Agency(EPA). It is estimated that 2–6% of workers exposed tothese contaminants eventually develop berylliosis.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCoughing, shortness of breath, and weight loss that\\nbegin abruptly can be a symptom of acute berylliosis. Thiscondition is caused by beryllium air pollution that inflamesthe lungs making them rigid; it can affect the eyes and skinas well. People who have acute berylliosis are usually veryill. Most recover, but some die of the disease.\\nChronic berylliosis is an allergic reaction to long-\\nterm exposure to even low levels of beryllium dust orfumes. A systemic disease that causes formation ofabnormal lung tissue and enlargement of the lymphnodes, chronic berylliosis also may affect other parts ofthe body. The symptoms of chronic berylliosis are large-ly the same as those seen in acute berylliosis, but theydevelop more slowly.\\nDiagnosis\\nBerylliosis is initially suspected if a patient with symp-\\ntoms of the disease has a history of beryllium exposure. Achest x ray shows characteristic changes in the lungs.\\nHowever, since these changes can resemble those causedby other lung diseases, further testing may be necessary.\\nThe beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT),\\na blood test that can detect beryllium sensitivity (i.e. anallergic reaction to beryllium), is used to screen individualsat risk of developing berylliosis. When screening resultsreveal a high level of sensitivity, BeLPT is performed oncells washed from the lungs. This test is now consideredthe most definitive diagnostic test for berylliosis.\\nTreatment\\nIndividuals with beryllium sensitivity or early-stage\\nberylliosis should be transferred from tasks that involveberyllium exposure and regularly examined to determinewhether the disease has progressed.\\nAcute berylliosis is a serious disease that occasion-\\nally may be fatal. Ventilators can help patients with acuteberylliosis breathe. Prompt corticosteroid therapy isrequired to lessen lung inflammation.\\nChronic beryllium disease is incurable. Corticos-\\nteroid therapy is often prescribed, but it is not certain thatsteroids can alter the progression of the disease, and theyhave no effect on scarring of lung tissue. Cleansing thelungs of beryllium is a slow process, so long-term thera-py may be required. Chelation therapy is currently\\nunder investigation as a treatment for the disease.\\nPrognosis\\nMost patients with acute berylliosis recover fully\\n7–10 days after treatment begins, and the disease usuallycauses no after effects.\\nPatients whose lungs are severely damaged by\\nchronic berylliosis may experience fatal heart failure\\nbecause of the strain placed on the heart.\\nPrevention\\nEliminating exposure to beryllium is the surest way\\nto prevent berylliosis. Screening workers who areexposed to beryllium fumes or dust or who develop anallergic reaction to these substances is an effective wayto control symptoms and prevent disease progression.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 472BerylliosisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 472'),\n",

Increased production or destruction ofthese cells causes Beta\\n2-microglobulin levels in the blood\\nto increase. This increase is seen in people with cancersinvolving white blood cells, but it is particularly mean-ingful in people newly diagnosed with multiple myelo-ma. Multiple myeloma is a malignancy (cancer) of a cer-tain kind of white blood cell, called a plasma cell. At thetime of diagnosis, the Beta\\n2-microglobulin levels reflect\\nhow advanced the disease is and the likely prognosis forthat person.\\nWhen kidney disease is suspected, comparing blood\\nand urine levels helps identify where the kidney is dam-aged. Beta\\n2-microglobulin normally is filtered out of the\\nblood by the kidney’s glomeruli (a round mass of capil-lary loops leading to each kidney tubule), only to be par-tially reabsorbed back into the blood when it reaches thekidney’s tubules. In glomerular kidney disease, theglomeruli can’t filter it out of the blood, so levelsincrease in the blood and decrease in the urine. In tubularkidney disease, the tubules can’t reabsorb it back into theblood, so urine levels rise and blood levels fall. After akidney transplant, increased blood levels may be an earlysign of rejection.\\nIncreased urinary levels are found in people with\\nkidney damage caused by high exposure to the heavymetals cadmium and mercury. Periodic testing of work-ers exposed to these metals helps to detect beginning kid-ney damage.\\nBeta\\n2-microglobulin levels also rise during infec-\\ntion with some viruses, including cytomegalovirus andhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Studies show\\nthat as HIV disease advances, beta\\n2-microglobulin lev-\\nels rise.\\nDescription\\nTesting methods vary, but most involve adding the\\nperson’s serum—the yellow, liquid part of blood—orurine to one or more substances that bind to beta\\n2-\\nmicroglobulin in the serum or urine. The amount of thesubstance(s) bound to beta\\n2-microglobulin is measured\\nand the original amount of beta2-microglobulin is\\ndetermined.\\nThe test is covered by insurance when medically\\nnecessary.

It is a rare tumor with poor outcome for most patients.\\nDescription\\nBile is a substance manufactured by the liver that\\naids in the digestion of food. Bile ducts are channels thatcarry the bile from the liver to the small intestine. Likethe tributaries of a river, the small bile ducts in the liverconverge into two large bile ducts called the left and righthepatic ducts. These exit the liver and join to form thecommon hepatic duct. The gallbladder, which concen-trates and stores the bile, empties into the commonhepatic duct to form the common bile duct. Finally, thislarge duct connects to the small intestine where the bilecan help digest food. Collectively, this network of bileducts is called the biliary tract.\\nBile duct cancer originates from the cells that line\\nthe inner surface of the bile ducts. A tumor may ariseanywhere along the biliary tract, either within or outsideof the liver. Bile duct tumors are typically slow-growingtumors that spread by local invasion of neighboringstructures and by way of lymphatic channels.\\nBile duct cancer is an uncommon malignancy. In the\\nUnited States, approximately one case arises per 100,000people per year, but it is more common in SoutheastAsia. It occurs in men only slightly more often than inwomen, and it is most commonly diagnosed in people intheir 50s and 60s.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nA number of risk factors are associated with the\\ndevelopment of bile duct cancer:\\n• Primary sclerosing cholangitis . This disease is charac-\\nterized by extensive scarring of the biliary tract, some-times associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\\n• Choledochal cysts. These are abnormal dilatations of\\nthe biliary tract that usually form during fetal develop-ment. There is evidence that these cysts may rarelyarise during adulthood.\\n• Hepatolithiasis. This is the condition of stone formation\\nwithin the liver (not including gallbladder stones).\\n• Liver flukes. Parasitic infection with certain worms is\\nthought to be at least partially responsible for the higherprevalence of bile duct cancer in Southeast Asia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 477Bile duct cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 477'),\n",

Exposure to Thorotrast has beenimplicated in the development of cancer of the liver aswell as the bile ducts.\\nSymptoms\\nJaundice is the first symptom in 90% of patients.\\nThis occurs when the bile duct tumor causes an obstruc-tion in the normal flow of bile from the liver to the smallintestine. Bilirubin, a component of bile, builds up withinthe liver and is absorbed into the bloodstream in excessamounts. This can be detected in a blood test, but it canalso manifest as yellowish discoloring of the skin andeyes. The bilirubin in the bloodstream also makes theurine appear dark. Additionally, the patient may experi-ence generalized itching due to the deposition of bile\\ncomponents in the skin. Normally, a portion of the bile isexcreted in stool; bile actually gives stool its browncolor. But when the biliary tract is obstructed by tumor,the stools may appear pale.\\nAbdominal pain ,fatigue , weight loss, and poor\\nappetite are less common symptoms.

Sometimes the biliary tract can become\\ninfected, but this is normally a rare consequence of inva-sive tests. Infection causes fever , chills, and pain in the\\nright upper portion of the abdomen.\\nDiagnosis\\nCertain laboratory tests of the blood may aid in the\\ndiagnosis. The most important one is the test for elevatedbilirubin levels in the bloodstream. Levels of alkalinephosphatase and CA 19-9 may also be elevated.\\nWhen symptoms, physical signs, and blood tests\\npoinmt toward an abnormality of the biliary tract, thenthe next step involves radiographic tests. Ultrasound andcomputed tomography (CT scan) are noninvasive andrapid. These tests can often detect the actual tumor aswell as dilatation of the obstructed biliary tract. If thesetests indicate the presence of a tumor, then cholangiogra-phy is required. This procedure involves injecting dyeinto the biliary tract to obtain anatomic images of the bileducts and the tumor. The specialist that performs this testcan also insert small tubes, or stents, into a partiallyobstructed portion of the bile duct to prevent furtherobstruction by growth of the tumor. This is vitally impor-tant since it may be the only intervention that is possiblein certain patients. Cholangiography is an invasive testthat carries a small risk of infection of the biliary tract.The objective of these radiological tests is to determinethe size and location of the tumor, as well as the extent ofspread to nearby structures.\\nThe treatment of bile duct tumors is usually not\\naffected by the specific type of cancer cells that comprisethe tumor. For this reason, some physicians forego biop-sy of the tumor.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment is with surgical resection (removal) of\\nthe tumor and all involved structures. Unfortunately,sometimes the cancer has already spread too far when thediagnosis is made. Thus, in the treatment of bile duct can-cer, the first question to answer is if the tumor may besafely resected by surgery with reasonable benefit to thepatient. If the cancer involves certain blood vessels or hasspread widely throughout the liver, then resection may notbe possible. Sometimes further invasive testing is required.\\nAngiography can determine if the blood vessels are\\ninvolved. Laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that allows\\nthe surgeon to directly assess the tumor and nearby lymphnodes without making a large incision in the abdomen. Onlyabout 45% of bile duct cancers are ultimately resectable.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 478Bile duct cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 478'),\n",

Tumors inthe middle portion of the biliary tract can be removedalone. Tumors of the lower end of the biliary tract mayrequire extensive resection of part of the pancreas, smallintestine, and stomach to ensure complete resection.\\nUnfortunately, sometimes the cancer appears\\nresectable by all the radiological and invasive tests, but isfound to be unresectable during surgery. In this scenario, abypass operation can relieve the biliary tract obstruction,but does not remove the tumor itself.

Half of all liver transplants are done for this reason.\\nThe normal anatomy of the bile system begins with-\\nin the liver, where thousands of tiny bile ducts collectbile from liver cells. These ducts merge into larger andlarger channels, like streams flowing into rivers, untilthey all pour into a single duct that empties into the duo-denum (first part of the small intestine). Between theliver and the duodenum this duct has a side channel con-nected to the gall bladder. The gall bladder stores bileand concentrates it, removing much of its water content.Then, when a meal hits the stomach, the gall bladdercontracts and empties its contents.\\nBile is a mixture of waste chemicals that the liver\\nremoves from the circulation and excretes through thebiliary system into the intestine. On its way out, bileassists in the digestion of certain nutrients. If bile cannotget out because the channels are absent or blocked, itbacks up into the liver and eventually into the rest of thebody. The major pigment in bile is a chemical calledbilirubin, which is yellow. Bilirubin is a breakdown prod-uct of hemoglobin (the red chemical in blood that carriesoxygen). If the body accumulates an excess of bilirubin,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 479Biliary atresiaGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 479'),\n",

Bile also turns the stool\\nbrown. Without it, stools are the color of clay.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nIt is possible that a viral infection is responsible for\\nthis disease, but evidence is not yet convincing. Thecause remains unknown.\\nThe affected infant will appear normal at birth and\\nduring the newborn period. After two weeks the normaljaundice of the newborn will not disappear, and the\\nstools will probably be clay-colored. At this point, thecondition will come to the attention of a physician. If not,the child’s abdomen will begin to swell, and the infantwill get progressively more ill. Nearly all untreated chil-dren will die of liver failure within two years.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe persistence of jaundice beyond the second week\\nin a newborn with clay-colored stools is a sure sign ofobstruction to the flow of bile. An immediate evaluationthat includes blood tests and imaging of the biliary sys-tem will confirm the diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery is the only treatment. Somehow the surgeon\\nmust create an adequate pathway for bile to escape theliver into the intestine. The altered anatomy of the biliarysystem is different in every case, calling upon the sur-geon’s skill and experience to select and execute the most\\neffective among several options. If the obstruction is onlybetween the gall bladder and the intestine, it is possible toattach a piece of intestine directly to the gall bladder. Morelikely, the upper biliary system will also be inadequate,and the surgeon will attach a piece of intestine directly tothe liver—the Kasai procedure. In its wisdom, the bodywill discover that the tiny bile ducts in that part of the liverare discharging their bile directly into the intestine. Bilewill begin to flow in that direction, and the channels willgradually enlarge. Survival rates for the Kasai procedureare commonly 50% at five years and 15% at 10 years. Per-sistent disease in the liver gradually destroys the organ.\\nLiver transplantation must be anticipated in all but\\nthe few patients who continue to do well after a Kasaiprocedure. Accumulating experience and newer tech-niques of liver transplantation are producing very gratify-ing early results.\\nPrognosis\\nBefore liver transplants became available, even\\nprompt and effective surgery did not cure the wholeproblem. Biliary drainage can usually be established, butthe patients still have a defective biliary system thatdevelops progressive disease and commonly leads to anearly death . Transplantation now achieves up to 90%\\none-year survival rates and promises to prevent thechronic disease that used to accompany earlier proce-dures.\\nPrevention\\nThe specific cause of this birth defect is unknown, so\\nall that women can do is to practice the many generalpreventive measures, even before they conceive.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 480Biliary atresiaLiver Cystic duct\\nPyloric sphincter\\nPancreasDuodenumGallbladder\\nCommon bile duct\\nBiliary atresia is a congenital condition in which the path-\\nway for bile to drain from the liver to the intestine is unde-veloped.

The binge eaterconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a shorttime period, but unlike a bulimic, does not regularlyengage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors(for example, excessive exercise , vomiting, taking laxa-\\ntives ) following the binge episodes.\\nDescription\\nBED typically strikes individuals sometime between\\nadolescence and the early twenties. Because of the natureof the disorder, most BED patients are overweight orobese. Studies of weight loss programs have shown thatan average of 30% of individuals enrolling in these pro-grams report binge eating behavior.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBinge eating episodes may act as a psychological\\nrelease for excessive emotional stress . Other circum-\\nstances that may predispose an individual to BED includeheredity and affective disorders, such as major depression.BED patients are also more likely to have a comorbid, orco-existing, diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam-ple, compulsive buying), post-traumatic stress disorder\\n(PTSD), panic disorder , or personality disorders .Individuals who develop BED often come from fam-\\nilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance offood, for example, as a source of comfort in times ofemotional distress. As children, BED patients may havebeen taught to clean their plate regardless of theirappetite, or that finishing a meal made them a “good”girl or boy. Cultural attitudes towards beauty and thin-ness may also be a factor in the BED equation.\\nDuring binge episodes, BED patients experience a\\ndefinite sense of lost control over their eating. They eatquickly and to the point of discomfort even if they aren’thungry. They typically binge alone two or more times aweek, and often feel depressed and guilty once theepisode has concluded.\\nDiagnosis\\nBinge eating disorder is usually diagnosed and treated\\nby a psychiatrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to aninterview with the patient, personality and behavioralinventories, such as the Minnesota Multiphasic Person-\\nality Inventory (MMPI), may be administered as part of\\nthe assessment process. One of several clinical inventories,or scales, may also be used to assess depressive symptoms,including the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) orBeck Depression Inventory (BDI). These tests may beadministered in an outpatient or hospital setting.\\nTreatment\\nMany BED individuals binge after long intervals of\\nexcessive dietary restraint; therapy helps normalize thispattern. The initial goal of BED treatment is to teach thepatient to gain control over his eating behavior by focus-ing on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog-\\nnitive-behavioral therapy ,group therapy , or interper-\\nsonal psychotherapy may be employed to uncover theemotional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioralpatterns behind the binge eating.\\nBecause the prevalence of depression in BED\\npatients is high, psychopharmacological treatment withantidepressants may also be prescribed. Once the bingeeating behavior is curbed and depressive symptoms arecontrolled, the physical symptoms of BED can beaddressed. The overweight BED patient may be placedon a moderate exercise program and a nutritionist may beconsulted to educate the patient on healthy food choicesand strategies for weight loss.\\nPrognosis\\nThe poor dietary habits and obesity that are sympto-\\nmatic of BED can lead to serious health problems, such ashigh blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 481Binge-eating disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 481'),\n",

The name biofeedback refers to the bio-logical signals that are fed back, or returned, to the patientin order for the patient to develop techniques of manipu-lating them.\\nPurpose\\nBiofeedback has been used to successfully treat a\\nnumber of disorders and their symptoms, including tem-\\nporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic pain,\\nirritable bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome,\\nepilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder(ADHD ), migraine headaches, anxiety , depression, trau-\\nmatic brain injury, and sleep disorders .\\nIllnesses that may be triggered at least in part by\\nstress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain\\ntypes of headaches, high blood pressure, bruxism (teeth\\ngrinding), post-traumatic stress disorder , eating disor-\\nders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disorders may\\nbe treated successfully by teaching patients the ability torelax and release both muscle and mental tension.Biofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensivetreatment program for some of these disorders.\\nNASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat\\nastronauts who suffer from severe space sickness, duringwhich the autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scien-tists at the University of Tennessee have adapted thesetechniques to treat individuals suffering from severenausea and vomiting that is also rooted in autonomic\\nnervous system dysfunction.\\nRecent research also indicates that biofeedback may\\nbe a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti-\\nnence regain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-\\nfloor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better con-trol over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors areplaced on the muscles to train the patient where they areand when proper contractions are taking place.\\nDescription\\nOrigins\\nIn 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist,\\nsuggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 482BiofeedbackGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 482'),\n",

As a result of his experiments, he showed thatsuch autonomic processes were controllable. This workled to the creation of biofeedback therapy. Willer’s workwas expanded by other researchers. Thereafter, researchperformed in the 1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. BarrySterman established that both cats and monkeys could betrained to control their brain wave patterns. Sterman thenused his research techniques on human patients withepilepsy, where he was able to reduce seizures by 60%with the use of biofeedback techniques. Throughout the1970s, other researchers published reports of their use ofbiofeedback in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias ,\\nheadaches, Raynaud’s syndrome, and excess stomachacid, and as a tool for teaching deep relaxation. Since theearly work of Miller and Sterman, biofeedback hasdeveloped into a front-line behavioral treatment for aneven wider range of disorders and symptoms.\\nDuring biofeedback, special sensors are placed on\\nthe body. These sensors measure the bodily function thatis causing the patient problem symptoms, such as heartrate, blood pressure, muscle tension (EMG or elec-tromyographic feedback), brain waves (EEC or elec-troencophalographic feedback), respiration, and bodytemperature (thermal feedback), and translates the infor-mation into a visual and/or audible readout, such as apaper tracing, a light display, or a series of beeps.\\nWhile the patient views the instantaneous feedback\\nfrom the biofeedback monitors, he or she begins to recog-nize what thoughts, fears, and mental images influence hisor her physical reactions. By monitoring this relationshipbetween mind and body, the patient can then use thesesame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as theseact as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-ious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,brain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodilyfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,mental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.\\nAs the biofeedback response takes place, patients\\ncan actually see or hear the results of their efforts instant-ly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback equip-ment. Once these techniques are learned and the patientis able to recognize the state of relaxation or visualiza-tion necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeedbackequipment itself is no longer needed. The patient thenhas a powerful, portable, and self-administered treatmenttool to deal with problem symptoms.\\nBiofeedback that specializes in reading and altering\\nbrain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback . The\\nbrain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta,theta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre-quency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brain\\nwave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, whichoccur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35Hz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averagesfall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-arousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be presentin conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-order, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxietydisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessivestress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizingthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14Hz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-es on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) andtheta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated withdeep, meditative states, and has been used with somesuccess in substance abuse treatment.\\nThrough brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback\\ncan be useful in treating a variety of disorders that aresuspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, suchas epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraineheadaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,and sleep disorders. The equipment used for neurofeed-back usually uses a monitor as an output device. Themonitor displays specific patterns that the patientattempts to change by producing the appropriate type ofbrain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient forproducing the appropriate brain wave by producing apositive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children maybe rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis-played video game.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 483Biofeedback\\nA patient undergoing biofeedback therapy.

Therapists usually recommend thattheir patients practice both biofeedback and relaxationtechniques on their own at home.\\nPreparations\\nBefore initiating biofeedback treatment, the thera-\\npist and patient will have an initial consultation to recordthe patients medical history and treatment backgroundand discuss goals for therapy.\\nBefore a neurofeedback session, an EEG is taken\\nfrom the patient to determine his or her baseline brain-wave pattern.\\nBiofeedback typically is performed in a quiet and\\nrelaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for thepatient. Depending on the type and goals of biofeedbackbeing performed, one or more sensors will be attached tothe patient’s body with conductive gel and/or adhesives.These may include:\\n• Electromyographic (EMG) sensors. EMG sen-\\nsors measure electrical activity in the muscles, specifical-ly muscle tension. In treating TMJ or bruxism, these sen-sors would be placed along the muscles of the jaw.Chronic pain might be treated by monitoring electricalenergy in other muscle groups.\\n• Galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors. These are elec-\\ntrodes placed on the fingers that monitor perspiration,or sweat gland, activity. These may also be called skinconductance level (SCL).\\n• Temperature sensors. Temperature, or thermal, sensors\\nmeasure body temperature and changes in blood flow.\\n• Electroencephalography (EEG) sensors. These elec-\\ntrodes are applied to the scalp to measure the electricalactivity of the brain, or brain waves.\\n• Heart rate sensors. A pulse monitor placed on the finger\\ntip can monitor pulse rate.\\n• Respiratory sensors. Respiratory sensors monitor oxy-\\ngen intake and carbon dioxide output.\\nPrecautions\\nIndividuals who use a pacemaker or other\\nimplantable electrical devices should inform theirbiofeedback therapist before starting treatments, as cer-tain types of biofeedback sensors have the potential tointerfere with these devices.\\nBiofeedback may not be suitable for some patients.\\nPatients must be willing to take a very active role in thetreatment process. And because biofeedback focuses\\nstrictly on behavioral change, those patients who wish togain insight into their symptoms by examining their pastmight be better served by psychodynamic therapy.\\nBiofeedback may also be inappropriate for cogni-\\ntively impaired individuals, such as those patients withorganic brain disease or a traumatic brain injury, depend-ing on their levels of functioning.\\nPatients with specific pain symptoms of unknown\\norigin should undergo a thorough medical examinationbefore starting biofeedback treatments to rule out anyserious underlying disease. Once a diagnosis has beenmade, biofeedback can be used concurrently with con-ventional treatment.\\nBiofeedback may only be one component of a com-\\nprehensive treatment plan. For illnesses and symptomsthat are manifested from an organic disease process, suchas cancer or diabetes, biofeedback should be an adjunct\\nto (complementary to), and not a replacement for, con-ventional medical treatment.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects to properly adminis-\\ntered biofeedback or neurofeedback sessions.\\nResearch and general acceptance\\nPreliminary research published in late 1999 indicat-\\ned that neurofeedback may be a promising new tool inthe treatment of schizophrenia . Researchers reported\\nthat schizophrenic patients had used neurofeedback tosimulate brain wave patterns that antipsychotic medica-tions produce in the brain. Further research is needed todetermine what impact this may have on treatment forschizophrenia.\\nThe use of biofeedback techniques to treat an array of\\ndisorders has been extensively described in the medical lit-erature. Controlled studies for some applications are limit-ed, such as for the treatment of menopausal symptoms andpremenstrual disorder (PMS). There is also some debateover the effectiveness of biofeedback in ADHD treatment,and the lack of controlled studies on that application. Whilemany therapists, counselors, and mental health profession-als have reported great success with treating their ADHDpatients with neurofeedback techniques, some criticsattribute this positive therapeutic impact to a placebo effect.\\nThere may also be some debate among mental\\nhealth professionals as to whether biofeedback should beconsidered a first line treatment for some mental illness-es, and to what degree other treatments, such as medica-tion, should be employed as an adjunct therapy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 484BiofeedbackGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 484'),\n",

The major-ity of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodesof mania and depression.\\nDescription\\nIn the United States alone, bipolar disorder afflicts\\nalmost two million people at an annual cost of over $45billion, according to a report by the National Institutes ofMental Health. The average age of onset of bipolar disor-der is from adolescence through the early twenties. How-ever, because of the complexity of the disorder, a correctdiagnosis can be delayed for several years or more. In asurvey of bipolar patients conducted by the NationalDepressive and Manic Depressive Association(MDMDA), one-half of respondents reported visitingthree or more professionals before receiving a correctdiagnosis, and over one-third reported a wait of ten yearsor more before they were correctly diagnosed.\\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\\nDisorders, Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ), the diagnostic stan-\\ndard for mental health professionals in the United States,defines four separate categories of bipolar disorder: bipo-lar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia, and bipolar not-otherwise-specified (NOS).\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 485Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 485'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 499}, page_content='Bipolar I disorder is characterized by manic\\nepisodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. Abipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings ofself-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased socia-bility, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities,coupled with the characteristics of irritability, impa-tience, impulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreasedneed for sleep. Usually this manic period is followed bya period of depression, although a few bipolar I individu-als may not experience a major depressive episode.Mixed states, where both manic or hypomanic symptomsand depressive symptoms occur at the same time, alsooccur frequently with bipolar I patients (for example,depression with the racing thoughts of mania). Also, dys-phoric mania is common (mania characterized by angerand irritability).\\nBipolar II disorder is characterized by major depres-\\nsive episodes alternating with episodes of hypomania, amilder form of mania. Bipolar depression may be diffi-cult to distinguish from a unipolar major depressiveepisode. Patients with bipolar depression tend to haveextremely low energy, retarded mental and physicalprocesses, and more profound fatigue (for example,\\nhypersomnia; a sleep disorder marked by a need forexcessive sleep or sleepiness when awake) than unipolardepressives.\\nCyclothymia refers to the cycling of hypomanic\\nepisodes with depression that does not reach major depres-sive proportions. A third of patients with cyclothymia willdevelop bipolar I or II disorder later in life.\\nA phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up\\nto 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,manic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently;at least 4 times in 12 months; to meet the diagnostic defi-nition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the patientmay bounce between manic and depressive states severaltimes within a 24-hour period. This condition is veryhard to distinguish from mixed states.\\nBipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do\\nnot clearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia diag-noses.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly\\ndefined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have afamily history of affective or emotional disorders,researchers have searched for a genetic link to the disor-der. Several studies have uncovered a number of possiblegenetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar dis-order. Another possible biological cause under investiga-tion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up inthe cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and other\\nneurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated inbipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation.\\nOver half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder\\nhave a history of substance abuse. There is a high rate ofassociation between cocaine abuse and bipolar disorder.\\nSome studies have shown up to 30% of abusers meetingthe criteria for bipolar disorder. The emotional and physi-cal highs and lows of cocaine use correspond to themanic depression of the bipolar patient, making the dis-order difficult to diagnosis.\\nFor some bipolar patients, manic and depressive\\nepisodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressiveepisodes are typical during winter and fall, and manicepisodes are more probable in the spring and summermonths.\\nSymptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include\\nlow energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen-trating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation(slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manicepisodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lackof inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need forsleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. Inextreme cases, mania can induce hallucinations and\\nother psychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.\\nDiagnosis\\nBipolar disorder is usually diagnosed and treated by\\na psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis-tance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven-tories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s mentalstatus and determine the presence of bipolar symptoms.These include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial InventoryIII (MCMI-III), Minnesota Multiphasic Personality\\nInventory II (MMPI-2 ), the Internal State Scale (ISS),\\nthe Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI), and the YoungMania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests are verbal and/orwritten and are administered in both hospital and outpa-tient settings.\\nPsychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri-\\nteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV ) as a guide-\\nline for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mentalillnesses. DSM-IV describes a manic episode as an\\nabnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period ofat least one week that is distinguished by at least three ofthe mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreasedneed for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis-tractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces-sive involvement in pleasurable activities that have ahigh potential for painful consequences.

DSM-IV notes that unlike manic episodes, hypoman-\\nic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in socialor occupational functioning, do not require hospitaliza-tion, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,because hypomanic episodes are characterized by highenergy and goal directed activities and often result in apositive outcome, or are perceived in a positive mannerby the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.\\nBipolar symptoms often present differently in chil-\\ndren and adolescents. Manic episodes in these age groupsare typically characterized by more psychotic featuresthan in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz-\\nophrenia . Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-\\ntability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,symptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather thanacute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,impulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-nosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ).\\nFurthermore, their aggression often leads to violence,which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder .\\nSubstance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-\\nscription or over-the-counter medication can mask ormimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-stance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-od of detoxification and abstinence before a mood disor-\\nder is diagnosed and treatment begins.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of bipolar disorder is usually by means of\\nmedication. A combination of mood stabilizing agentswith antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsantsis used to regulate manic and depressive episodes.\\nMood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-\\nmazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate themanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:\\n• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,\\nLithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-quently prescribed drugs available for the treatment ofbipolar mania and depression. Because the drug takesfour to ten days to reach a therapeutic level in the blood-stream, it is sometimes prescribed in conjunction withneuroleptics and/or benzodiazepines to provide more\\nimmediate relief of a manic episode. Lithium has alsobeen shown to be effective in regulating bipolar depres-sion, but is not recommended for mixed mania. Lithiummay not be an effective long-term treatment option for\\nrapid cyclers, who typically develop a tolerance for it, ormay not respond to it. Possible side effects of the druginclude weight gain, thirst, nausea, and hand tremors .\\nProlonged lithium use may also cause hyperthyroidism\\n(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by heart palpita-\\ntions , nervousness, the presence of goiter , sweating,\\nand a wide array of other symptoms.)\\n• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant\\ndrug usually prescribed in conjunction with other moodstabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-lar patients who have not responded well to lithiumtherapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movementare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.As of early 1998, carbamazepine did not have an FDA-cleared indication for mania.\\n• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic\\nacid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available thathas been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-lar and mixed states patients. Valproate is prescribedalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or lithi-um. Stomach cramps, indigestion ,diarrhea , hair loss,\\nappetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or gain aresome of the common side effects of valproate. Note: val-proate is also approved for the treatment of mania.\\nBecause antidepressants may stimulate manic\\nepisodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typicallyshort-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAO inhibitors) are prescribed for episodes of bipolardepression. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipo-lar depression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolarpatients and are, therefore, not a preferred treatmentoption for bipolar depression.\\n• SSRIs, such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft),\\nand paroxetine (Paxil), regulate depression by regulatinglevels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter. Anxiety , diarrhea,\\ndrowsiness, headache , sweating, nausea, sexual prob-\\nlems, and insomnia are all possible side effects of SSRIs.\\n• MAOIs such as tranylcypromine (Parnate) and phenel-\\nzine (Nardil) block the action of monoamine oxidase(MAO), an enzyme in the central nervous system.Patients taking MAOIs must cut foods high in tyramine(found in aged cheeses and meats) out of their diet toavoid hypotensive side effects.\\n• Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is a heterocyclic antidepres-\\nsant. The exact neurochemical mechanism of the drugis not known, but it has been effective in regulatingbipolar depression in some patients. Side effects ofbupropion include agitation, anxiety, confusion, tremor,dry mouth , fast or irregular heartbeat, headache, and\\ninsomnia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 487Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 487'),\n",

However, because of the convenience ofdrug treatment and the stigma sometimes attached toECT therapy, ECT is usually employed after all phar-maceutical treatment options have been explored. ECTis given under anesthesia and patients are given a mus-cle relaxant medication to prevent convulsions. Thetreatment consists of a series of electrical pulses thatmove into the brain through electrodes on the patient’shead. Although the exact mechanisms behind the suc-cess of ECT therapy are not known, it is believed thatthis electrical current alters the electrochemicalprocesses of the brain, consequently relieving depres-sion. Headaches, muscle soreness, nausea, and confu-sion are possible side effects immediately following anECT procedure. Temporary memory loss has also beenreported in ECT patients. In bipolar patients, ECT isoften used in conjunction with drug therapy.\\nAdjunct treatments are used in conjunction with a\\nlong-term pharmaceutical treatment plan:\\n• Long-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam (Klon-\\napin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid treat-ment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate patients untilmania or hypomania have waned and mood stabilizingagents can take effect. Sedation is a common effect, and\\nclumsiness, lightheadedness, and slurred speech are otherpossible side effects of benzodiazepines.\\n• Neuroleptics such as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and\\nhaloperidol (Haldol) are also used to control maniawhile a mood stabilizer such as lithium or valproatetakes effect. Because neuroleptic side effects can besevere (difficulty in speaking or swallowing, paralysis\\nof the eyes, loss of balance control, muscle spasms,severe restlessness, stiffness of arms and legs, tremorsin fingers and hands, twisting movements of body, andweakness of arms and legs), benzodiazepines are gener-ally preferred over neuroleptics.\\n• Psychotherapy and counseling. Because bipolar disorder\\nis thought to be biological in nature, therapy is recom-mended as a companion to, but not a substitute for, phar-maceutical treatment of the disease. Psychotherapy, suchas cognitive-behavioral therapy , can be a useful tool in\\nhelping patients and their families adjust to the disorder,in encouraging compliance to a medication regimen, andin reducing the risk of suicide. Also, educative counsel-ing is recommended for the patient and family.\\nCalcium channel blockers (nimodipine, or Nimo-\\ntop), typically used to treat angina and hypotension ,h a v e\\nbeen found effective, in a few small studies, for treatingrapid cyclers. Calcium channel blockers stop the excesscalcium build up in cells that is thought to be a cause ofbipolar disorder. They are usually used in conjunction with\\nother drug therapies such as carbamazepine or lithium.\\nClozapine (Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic\\nmedication used to control manic episodes in patientswho have not responded to typical mood stabilizingagents. The drug has also been a useful prophylactic, orpreventative treatment, in some bipolar patients. Commonside effects of clozapine include tachycardia (rapid heartrate), hypotension, constipation , and weight gain. Agran-\\nulocytosis, a potentially serious but reversible conditionin which the white blood cells that typically fight infec-tion in the body are destroyed, is a possible side effect ofclozapine. Patients treated with the drug should undergoweekly blood tests to monitor white blood cell counts.\\nRisperidone (Risperdal) is an atypical antipsychotic\\nmedication that has been successful in controlling maniain several clinical trials when low doses were adminis-tered. The side effects of risperidone are mild comparedto many other antipsychotics (constipation, coughing,diarrhea, dry mouth, headache, heartburn , increased\\nlength of sleep and dream activity, nausea, runny nose,sore throat , fatigue, and weight gain).\\nLamotrigine (Lamictal, or LTG), an anticonvulsant\\nmedication, was found to alleviate manic symptoms in a1997 trial of 75 bipolar patients. The drug was used inconjunction with divalproex (divalproate) and/or lithium.Possible side effects of lamotrigine include skin rash,dizziness , drowsiness, headache, nausea and vomiting .\\nrTMS, or repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation\\nis a new and still experimental treatment for the depres-sive phase of bipolar disorder. In rTMS, a large magnet isplaced on the patient’s head and magnetic fields of dif-ferent frequency are generated to stimulate the left frontcortex of the brain. Unlike ECT, rTMS requires no anes-thesia and does not induce seizures.\\nAlternative treatment\\nGeneral recommendations include maintaining a\\ncalm environment, avoiding over stimulation, gettingplenty of rest, regular exercise , and proper diet. Chinese\\nherbs may soften mood swings. Biofeedback is effective\\nin helping some patients control symptoms such as irri-tability, poor self control, racing thoughts, and sleepproblems. A diet low in vanadium (a mineral found inmeats and other foods) and high in vitamin C may behelpful in reducing depression.\\nPrognosis\\nWhile most patients will show some positive response\\nto treatment, response varies widely, from full recovery to acomplete lack of response to all drug and/or ECT therapy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 488Bipolar disorderGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 488'),\n",

With proper treatment, thelife expectancy of the bipolar patient will increase by nearlyseven years and work productivity increases by ten years.\\nPrevention\\nThe ongoing medical management of bipolar disor-\\nder is critical to preventing relapse, or recurrence, ofmanic episodes. Even in carefully controlled treatmentprograms, bipolar patients may experience recurringepisodes of the disorder. Patient education in the form ofpsychotherapy or self-help groups is crucial for trainingbipolar patients to recognize signs of mania and depres-sion and to take an active part in their treatment program.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

More than 3,000 have been identified.\\nDescription\\nBirth defects are found in 2-3% of all newborn\\ninfants. This rate doubles in the first year, and reaches10% by age five, as more defects become evident and canbe diagnosed. Almost 20% of deaths in newborns arecaused by birth defects.\\nAbnormalities can occur in any major organ or part\\nof the body. Major defects are structural abnormalitiesthat affect the way a person looks and require medicaland/or surgical treatment. Minor defects are abnormali-ties that do not cause serious health or social problems.When multiple birth defects occur together and have asimilar cause, they are called syndromes. If two or moredefects tend to appear together but do not share the samecause, they are called associations.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe specific cause of many congenital abnormalities\\nis unknown, but several factors associated with pregnan-\\ncyand delivery can increase the risk of birth defects.\\nTeratogens\\nAny substance that can cause abnormal develop-\\nment of the egg in the mother’s womb is called a terato-gen. In the first two months after conception, the devel-oping organism is called an embryo; developmentalstages from two months to birth are called fetal. Growthis rapid, and each body organ has a critical period inwhich it is especially sensitive to outside influences.About 7% of all congenital defects are caused by expo-sure to teratogens.\\nDRUGS. Only a few drugs are known to cause birth\\ndefects, but all have the potential to cause harm. Thalido-mide is known to cause defects of the arms and legs; sev-eral other types also cause problems.\\n• Alcohol. Drinking large amounts of alcohol while preg-\\nnant causes a cluster of defects called fetal alcohol\\nsyndrome , which include mental retardation , heart\\nproblems, and growth deficiency.\\n•Antibiotics . Certain antibiotics are known tetratogens.\\nTetracycline affects bone growth and discolors theteeth. Drugs used to treat tuberculosis can lead to hear-\\ning problems and damage to a nerve in the head (cra-nial). Sulfa drugs are associated with abnormally highlevels of bilirubin in the newborn, which can causedeath .\\n• Anticonvulsants. Drugs given to prevent seizures can\\ncause serious problems in the developing fetus, includ-ing mental retardation and slow growth.\\n• Antipsychotic and antianxiety agents. Several drugs\\ngiven for anxiety and mental illness are known to cause\\nspecific defects.\\n• Antineoplastic agents. Drugs given to treat cancer can\\ncause major congenital malformations, especially centralnervous system defects. They may also be harmful to thehealth care worker who is giving them while pregnant.\\n• Hormones. Male hormones may cause masculinization\\nof a female fetus. A synthetic estrogen (DES) given inthe 1940s and 1950s causes an increased risk of cancerin the adult female children of the mothers whoreceived the drug.\\n• Recreational drugs. Drugs such as LSD have been asso-\\nciated with arm and leg abnormalities and central ner-vous system problems in infants. Crack cocaine has\\nalso been associated with birth defects. Since drugabusers tend to use many drugs and have poor nutri-\\ntion and prenatal care, it is hard to determine the effects\\nof individual drugs.\\nCHEMICALS. Environmental chemicals such as\\nfungicides, food additives, and pollutants are suspectedof causing birth defects, though this is difficult to prove.\\nRADIATION. Exposure of the mother to high levels of\\nradiation can cause small skull size (microcephaly), blind-ness, spina bifida , and cleft palate. How severe the defect\\nis depends on the duration and timing of the exposure.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 490Birth defectsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 490'),\n",

Three viruses are known to harm a\\ndeveloping baby: rubella , cytomegalovirus (CMV), and\\nherpes simplex. Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite that can be\\ncontracted from undercooked meat, from dirt, or fromhandling the feces of infected cats, causes serious prob-lems. Untreated syphilis in the mother is also harmful.\\nGenetic factors\\nA gene is a tiny, invisible unit containing informa-\\ntion (DNA) that guides how the body forms and func-tions. Each individual inherits tens of thousands of genesfrom each parent, arranged on 46 chromosomes. Genescontrol all aspects of the body, how it works, and all itsunique characteristics, including eye color and body size.Genes are influenced by chemicals and radiation, butsometimes changes in the genes are unexplained acci-dents. Each child gets half of its genes from each parent.In each pair of genes one will take precedence (domi-nant) over the other (recessive) in determining each trait,or characteristic. Birth defects caused by dominant inher-itance include a form of dwarfism called achondropla-\\nsia; high cholesterol ; Huntington’s disease, a progres-sive nervous system disorder; Marfan syndrome , which\\naffects connective tissue; some forms of glaucoma , and\\npolydactyly (extra fingers or toes).\\nIf both parents carry the same recessive gene, they\\nhave a one-in-four chance that the child will inherit thedisease. Recessive diseases are severe and may lead to anearly death. They include sickle cell anemia, a blood disor-der that affects blacks, and Tay-Sachs disease , which\\ncauses mental retardation in people of eastern EuropeanJewish heritage. Two recessive disorders that affect mostlywhites are: cystic fibrosis , a lung and digestive disorder,\\nand phenylketonuria (PKU), a metabolic disorder. If only\\none parent passes along the genes for the disorder, the nor-mal gene received from the other parent will prevent thedisease, but the child will be a carrier. Having the gene isnot harmful to the carrier, but there is the 25% chance ofthe genetic disease showing up in the child of two carriers.\\nSome disorders are linked to the sex-determining\\nchromosomes passed along by parents. Hemophilia ,a\\ncondition that prevents blood from clotting, andDuchenne muscular dystrophy , which causes muscle\\nweakness, are carried on the X chromosome.

This is more common in older mothers.The most common defect of this kind is Down syn-\\ndrome , a pattern of mental retardation and physical\\nabnormalities, often including heart defects, caused byinheriting three copies of a chromosome rather than thenormal pair.\\nA less understood cause of birth defects results from\\nthe interaction of genes from one or both parents plusenvironmental influences. These defects are thought toinclude:\\n• Cleft lip and palate, which are malformations of the\\nmouth\\n• Clubfoot, ankle or foot deformities.• Spina bifida, an open spine caused when the tube that\\nforms the brain and spinal chord does not close properly.\\n• Water on the brain ( hydrocephalus ), which causes\\nbrain damage.\\n•Diabetes mellitus , an abnormality in sugar metabolism\\nthat appears later in life.\\n• Heart defects.• Some forms of cancer.\\nA serious illness in the mother, such as an underac-\\ntive thyroid, or diabetes mellitus, in which her body can-not process sugar, can also cause birth defects in the child.\\nAn abnormal amount of amniotic fluid may indicate orcause birth defects. Amniotic fluid is the liquid that sur-rounds and protects the unborn child in the uterus. Too lit-tle of this fluid can interfere with lung or limb develop-ment. Too much amniotic fluid can accumulate if thefetus has a disorder that interferes with swallowing.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf there is a family history of birth defects or if the\\nmother is over 35 years old, then screening tests can bedone during pregnancy to gain information about thehealth of the baby.\\n• Alpha-fetoprotein test. This is a simple blood test that\\nmeasure the level of a substance called alpha-fetopro-tein that is associated with some major birth defects. Anabnormally high or low level may indicate the need forfurther testing.\\n• Ultrasound. The use of sound waves to examine the\\nshape, function, and age of the fetus is a common proce-dure. It can also detect many malformations, such asspina bifida, limb defects, and heart and kidney problems.\\n• Amniocentesis. This test is usually done between the\\n13th and 15th weeks of pregnancy. A small sample ofamniotic fluid is withdrawn through a thin needleinserted into the mother’s abdomen. Chromosomalanalysis can rule out Down syndrome and other geneticconditions.\\n• Chorionic villus sampling (CVS). This test can be done\\nas early as the ninth week of pregnancy to identifychromosome disorders and some genetic conditions. Athin needle is inserted through the abdomen or a slimtube is inserted through the vagina that takes a tiny tis-sue sample for testing.\\nIf a birth defect is suspected after a baby is born,\\nthen confirmation of the diagnosis is very important. Thepatient’s medical records and medical history may holdessential information. A careful physical examination\\nand laboratory tests should be done. Special diagnostictests can also provide genetic information in some cases.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment depends on the type of birth defect and\\nhow serious it is. When an abnormality has been identi-fied before birth, then delivery can be planned at a healthcare facility that is prepared to offer any special careneeded. Some abnormalities can be corrected withsurgery.

About 65% arecapillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks), 15% are cav-ernous (deep) hemangiomas, and the rest are mixtures.Hemangiomas are three times more common in girls.Usually, only one hemangioma is found, in 20% two arefound, while fewer than 5% have three or more. Lym-phangiomas are skin bumps caused by enlarged lymphvessels anywhere on the body.\\nVascular malformations are poorly formed blood or\\nlymph vessels that appear at birth or later in life. Onetype, the salmon patch (nevus simplex), a pink markcomposed of dilated capillaries, is found on the back ofthe neck (also called a stork bite) in 40% of newborns,and on the forehead and eyelids (also called an angel’skiss) in 20%. Stork bites are found in 70% of white and60% of black newborns.\\nFound in fewer than 1% of newborns, port-wine\\nstains (nevus flammeus), are vascular malformationscomposed of dilated capillaries in the upper and lowerlayers of the skin of the face, neck, arms, and legs. Oftenpermanent, these flat pink to red marks develop into darkpurple bumpy areas in later life; 85% appear on only oneside of the body.\\nAcquired hemangiomas include spider angiomas\\n(nevus araneus), commonly known as spider veins, andcherry angiomas (senile angiomas or Campbell de Mor-gan spots). Found around the eyes, cheekbones, arms,and legs, spider angiomas are red marks formed fromdilated blood vessels. They occur during pregnancy in\\n70% of white women and 10% of black women, in alco-holics and liver disease patients, and in 50% of children.Cherry angiomas, dilated capillaries found mainly on thetrunk, appear in the 30s, and multiply with aging .\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are no known causes for congenital skin\\nangiomas; they may be related to an inherited weakness ofvessel walls. Exposure to estrogen causes spider angiomasin pregnant women or those taking oral contraceptives .\\nSpider angiomas tend to run in families, and may be asso-ciated with liver disease, sun exposure, and trauma.\\nHemangiomas\\nHemangiomas first appear as single or multiple,\\nwhite or pale pink marks, ranging from 2-20 cm (average2-5 cm) in size. Some are symptomless while otherscause pain or bleeding, or interfere with normal function-ing when they are numerous, enlarged, infected, or ulcer-\\nated. Vision is affected by large marks on the eyelids. Spi-der and cherry angiomas are unsightly but symptomless.\\nEach type of hemangioma has a characteristic\\nappearance:\\n• Capillary hemangiomas (strawberry marks). These\\nround, raised marks are bright red and bumpy like astrawberry, and become white or gray when fading.\\n• Cavernous hemangiomas. These slightly raised, dome-\\nshaped, blue or purple swellings are sometimes associ-ated with lymphangiomas or involve the soft tissues,bone, or digestive tract.\\n• Spider angiomas. These are symptomless, reddish blue\\nmarks formed from blood-filled capillaries radiatingaround a central arteriole (small artery) in the shape ofa spider web.\\n• Cherry angiomas. These harmless, dilated capillaries\\nappear as tiny, bright red-to-violet colored bumps.\\n• Lymphangiomas. These dilated lymph vessels form light\\npink or yellow cysts (fluid- filled sacs) or swellings.\\nV ascular malformations\\nThese are faint, flat, pink stains that grow as the\\nchild grows into larger dark red or purple marks. Someare symptomless but others bleed if enlarged or injured.Disfiguring port-wine stains can cause emotional andsocial problems. About 5% of port-wine stains on theforehead and eyelids increase eye pressure due toinvolvement of the eye and surrounding nerves. Abnor-malities of the spinal cord, soft tissues, or bone may beassociated with severe port-wine stains.\\nEach type has a characteristic appearance:\\n• Salmon patches.

Patients with port-wine stains near the eye may require skull x rays ,com-\\nputed tomography scans , and vision and central ner-\\nvous system tests. Most insurance plans pay for diagno-sis and treatment of these conditions.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment choices for skin angiomas and vascular\\nmalformations depend on their type, location, and severity,and whether they cause symptoms, pain, or disfigurement.\\nWatchful waiting\\nNo treatment is given, but the mark is regularly exam-\\nined. This continues until the mark disappears, or requirestreatment. This approach is particularly appropriate for thetreatment of hemangiomas, which often do not requiretreatment, since they eventually shrink by themselves.\\nDrugs\\nCORTICOSTEROIDS. Daily doses of the anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs prednisone or prednisolone are given for upto 2 months with gradual reduction of the dose. The marksbegin to subside within 7-10 days, but may take up to 2months to fully disappear. If no response is seen in 2weeks, the drug is discontinued. Treatment may be repeat-ed. Side effects include growth retardation, increased bloodpressure and blood sugar, cataracts , glandular disorders,\\nand infection. The corticosteroids triamcinolone acetate\\nand betamethasone sodium phosphate or acetate are inject-ed directly into the marks with a response usually achievedwithin a week; additional injections are given in 4-6 weeks.Side effects include tissue damage at the injection site.\\nINTERFERON ALPHA-2A. This drug reduces cell\\ngrowth, and is used for vascular marks that affect vision,and that are unresponsive to corticosteroids. Given in dailyinjections under the skin, a response rate of 50% isachieved after about 7 months. Side effects include fever ,\\nchills, muscle and joint pain, vision disorders, low whiteand red blood cell counts, fatigue , elevated liver enzymes,\\nnausea, blood clotting problems, and nerve damage.\\nANTIBIOTICS. Oral or topical (applied to the skin)\\nantibiotics are prescribed for infected marks.\\nSurgery\\nLASER SURGERY. Lasers create intense heat that\\ndestroys abnormal blood vessels beneath the skin, with-out damaging normal skin. Two types of lasers are used:\\nthe flashlamp-pulsed dye laser (FPDL) and the neodymi-um:YAG (Nd:YAG) laser. The FPDL, used mainly forstrawberry marks and port-wine stains, penetrates to adepth of 1.8 mm and causes little scarring, while theNd:YAG laser penetrates to a depth of 6 mm, and is usedto treat deep hemangiomas. Laser surgery is not usually\\npainful, but can be uncomfortable. Anesthetic cream isused for FPDL treatment. Treatment with the Nd:YAGlaser requires local or general anesthesia. Children areusually sedated or anesthetized. Healing occurs within 2weeks. Side effects include bruising, skin discoloration,swelling, crusting, and minor bleeding.\\nSURGICAL EXCISION. Under local or general anes-\\nthesia, the skin is cut with a surgical instrument, and vas-cular marks or their scars are removed. The cut isrepaired with stitches or skin clips.\\nCRYOSURGERY. Vascular marks are frozen with an\\nextremely cold substance sprayed onto the skin. Wounds\\nheal with minimal scarring.\\nELECTRODESICCATION. Affected vessels are des-\\ntroyed with the current from an electric needle.\\nOther treatments\\nThese include:\\n• Sclerotherapy.

In the United States, where the dog popula-\\ntion exceeds 50 million, dogs surpass all other mammalsin the number of bites inflicted on humans. However,most dog-bite injuries are minor. A telephone survey ofU.S. households conducted in 1994 led researchers toestimate that 3,737,000 dog bites not requiring medicalattention occurred in the United States that year, versus757,000 that did require medical treatment. Studies alsoshow that most dog bites are from pets or other dogsknown to the bitten person, that males are more likelythan females to be bitten, and that children face a greaterrisk than adults. Each year, about 10-20 Americans,mostly children under 10 years of age, are killed by dogs.\\nDog bites result in an estimated 340,000 emergency-\\nroom visits annually throughout the United States. Morethan half of the bites seen by emergency departmentsoccur at home. Children under 10 years old, especiallyboys between 5 and 9 years of age, are more likely thanolder people to visit an emergency room for bite treat-ment. Children under 10 years old were also much moreliable to be bitten on the face, neck, and head. Nearly allof the injuries suffered by people seeking treatment inemergency rooms were of “low severity,” and most weretreated and released without being admitted to hospital orsent to another facility. Many of the bites resulted frompeople attempting to break up fights between animals.\\nCATS. Although cats are found in nearly a third of\\nU.S. households, cat bites are far less common than dogbites. According to one study, cats inflict perhaps400,000 harmful bites in the United States each year. Thetissue damage caused by cat bites is usually limited, butthey carry a high risk of infection. Whereas the infectionrate for dog bite injuries is 15-20%, the infection rate forcat bites is 30-40%. A typical person who has been bittenis a young girl playing with a pet.\\nHUMANS. Bites from mammals other than dogs and\\ncats are uncommon, with one exception—human bites.There are approximately 70,000 human bites each yearin the United States. Because the human mouth containsa multitude of potentially harmful microorganisms,human bites are more infectious than those of most otheranimals.\\nArthropods\\nArthropods are invertebrates belonging to the phy-\\nlum Arthropoda, which includes insects, arachnids, crus-taceans, and other subgroups. There are more than700,000 species in all. The list of arthropods that bite orsting humans is extensive and includes lice, bedbugs,fleas, mosquitoes, black flies, ants, chiggers, ticks, cen-tipedes, scorpions, and other species. Spiders, bees, andwasps are the three kinds of arthropod that most oftenbite people.\\nSPIDERS. In the United States, only two kinds of ven-\\nomous spider are truly dangerous: widow spiders andbrown (violin or fiddle) spiders. The black widow, whichis found in every state but Alaska, is probably the mostnotorious widow spider. It prefers dark, dry places such asbarns, garages, and outhouses, and also lives under rocksand logs. Disturbing a female black widow or its webmay provoke a bite. Brown spiders also prefer shelteredplaces, including clothing, and may bite if disturbed.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 497Bites and stingsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 497'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\Data\\\\Medical_book.pdf', 'page': 511}, page_content='BEES AND WASPS. Bees and wasps will sting to\\ndefend their nests or if they are disturbed. Species com-mon to the United States include honeybees, bumble-bees, yellow jackets, bald-faced hornets, brown hornets,and paper wasps. Of note are also Africanized beespecies, also called “killer bees” that are now found inthe United States since 1990. More than fifty Americansdie each year after being stung by a bee, wasp, or ant.Almost all of those deaths are the result of allergic reac-tions, and not of exposure to the venom itself.\\nSnakes\\nThere are 20 species of venomous snakes in the\\nUnited States. These snakes are found in every stateexcept Maine, Alaska, and Hawaii. Each year about8,000 Americans receive a venomous snakebite, but nomore than about 15 die, mostly from rattlesnake bites.\\nThe venomous snakes of the United States are divid-\\ned into two families, the Crotalidae (pit vipers) and theElapidae. Pit vipers, named after the small heat-sensingpit that lies between each eye and nostril, are responsiblefor about 99% of the venomous snakebites suffered byAmericans. Rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths(also called water moccasins) are pit vipers. This familyof snakes delivers its venom through two long, hingedfangs in the upper jaw. Some pit vipers carry a potentvenom that can threaten the brain and spinal cord. Thevenom of others, such as the copperheads, is less harmful.\\nThe Elapidae family includes two kinds of ven-\\nomous coral snakes indigenous to the southern and west-ern states. Because coral snakes are bashful creaturesthat come out only at night, they almost never bitehumans, and are responsible for approximately 25 bites ayear in the United States. Coral snakes also have shortfangs and a small mouth, which lowers the risk of a biteactually forcing venom into a person’s body. However,their venom is quite poisonous.\\nMarine animals\\nSeveral varieties of marine animal may bite or sting.\\nJellyfish and stingrays are two kinds that pose a threat topeople who live or vacation in coastal communities.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nMammals\\nDOGS. A typical dog bite results in a laceration, tear,\\npuncture, or crush injury. Bites from large, powerful dogsmay even cause fractures and dangerous internal\\ninjuries. Also, dogs trained to attack may bite repeatedlyduring a single episode. Infected bites usually cause pain,\\ncellulitis (inflammation of the connective tissues), and apus-filled discharge at the wound site within 8-24 hours.\\nMost infections are confined to the wound site, but manyof the microorganisms in the mouths of dogs can causesystemic and possibly life-threatening infections. Exam-ples are bacteremia and meningitis , especially severe in\\npeople diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syn-\\ndrome ( AIDS ) or other health condition that increases\\ntheir susceptibility to infection. Rabies is rare among pet\\ndogs in the United States, most of which have been vacci-nated against the disease. Tetanus is also rare but can be\\ntransmitted by a dog bite if the victim is not immunized.\\nCATS. The mouths of cats and dogs contain many of\\nthe same microorganisms. Cat scratches and bites arealso capable of transmitting the Bartonella henselae bac-\\nterium, which can lead to cat-scratch disease ,a n\\nunpleasant but usually not life-threatening illness.\\nCat bites are mostly found on the arms and hands.\\nSharp cat teeth typically leave behind a deep puncturewound that can reach muscles, tendons, and bones, whichare vulnerable to infection because of their comparativelypoor blood supply. This is why cat bites are much morelikely to become infected than dog bites. Also, people areless inclined to view cat bites as dangerous requiringimmediate attention; the risk that infection has set in bythe time a medical professional is consulted is thus greater.\\nHUMANS. Humans bites result from fights, sexual\\nactivity, medical and dental treatment, and seizures. Bitesalso raise the possibility of spousal or child abuse . Chil-\\ndren often bite other children, but those bites are hardlyever severe. Human bites are capable of transmitting awide range of dangerous diseases, including hepatitis B ,\\nsyphilis , and tuberculosis .\\nHuman bites fall into two categories: occlusional\\n(true) bites and clenched-fist injuries. The former presenta lower risk of infection. The latter, which are very infec-tious and can permanently damage the hand, usuallyresult from a fist hitting teeth during a fight. People oftenwait before seeking treatment for a clenched-fist injury,with the result that about half of such injuries are infect-ed by the time they are seen by a medical professional.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. As a rule, people rarely see a black widow\\nbite, nor do they feel the bite as it occurs. The first (andpossibly only) evidence that a person has been bitten maybe a mild swelling of the injured area and two red punc-ture marks. Within a short time, however, some victimsbegin to experience severe muscle cramps and rigidity ofthe abdominal muscles. Other possible symptoms includeexcessive sweating, nausea, vomiting, headaches, andvertigo as well as breathing, vision, and speech problems.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 498Bites and stingsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 498'),\n",

Inmost cases, however, the bite simply produces a hard,painful, itchy, and discolored area that heals withouttreatment in 2-3 days. The bite may also be accompaniedby a fever , chills, edema (an accumulation of excess tis-\\nsue fluid), nausea and vomiting ,dizziness , muscle and\\njoint pain, and a rash.\\nBEES AND WASPS. The familiar symptoms of bee\\nand wasp stings include pain, redness, swelling, and itch-iness in the area of the sting. Multiple stings can havemuch more severe consequences, such as anaphylaxis ,a\\nlife-threatening allergic reaction that occurs in hypersen-sitive persons.\\nSnakes\\nVenomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell\\nwithin 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Othersymptoms include skin blisters and discoloration, weak-ness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness, bruising, andtender lymph nodes. Severe poisoning can also lead to\\ntingling in the scalp, fingers, and toes, muscle contrac-tions, an elevated heart rate, rapid breathing, large dropsin body temperature and blood pressure, vomiting ofblood, and coma .\\nMany pit viper and coral snake bites (20-60%) fail to\\npoison (envenomate) their victim, or introduce only asmall amount of venom into the victim’s body. Thewounds , however, can still become infected by the harm-\\nful microorganisms that snakes carry in their mouths.\\nCoral snake bites are painful but may be hard to see.\\nOne to seven hours after the bite, a bitten person begins toexperience the effects of the venom, which include tinglingat the wound site, weakness, nausea, vomiting, excessivesalivation, and irrational behavior. Major nerves of thebody can become paralyzed for 6-14 days, causing doublevision, difficulty swallowing and speaking, respiratory\\nfailure , and other problems. Six to eight weeks may be\\nneeded before normal muscular strength is regained.\\nMarine animals\\nJELLYFISH. Jellyfish venom is delivered by barbs\\ncalled nematocysts, which are located on the creature’stentacles and penetrate the skin of people who brush upagainst them. Instantly painful and itchy red lesions usu-ally result. The pain can continue up to 48 hours. Severecases may lead to skin necrosis, muscle spasms and\\ncramps , vomiting, nausea, diarrhea , headaches, exces-sive sweating, and other symptoms. In rare instances,\\ncardiorespiratory failure may also occur.\\nSTINGRAYS. Tail spines are the delivery mechanism\\nfor stingray venom. Deep puncture wounds result that cancause an infection if pieces of spine become embedded inthe wound. A typical stingray injury scenario involves aperson who inadvertently steps on a resting stingray and islashed in the ankle by its tail. Stingray venom producesimmediate, excruciating pain that lasts several hours.Sometimes the victim suffers a severe reaction, includingvomiting, diarrhea, hemorrhage (bleeding), a drop in bloodpressure, and cardiac arrhythmia (disordered heart beat).\\nDiagnosis\\nMammals\\nDOGS. Gathering information on the circumstances\\nof a dog attack is a crucial part of treatment. Medicalprofessionals need to know when the attack occurred (thechances of infection increase dramatically if the woundhas been left untreated for more than eight hours) andwhat led to the attack (unprovoked attacks are more like-ly to be associated with rabies). A person’s general healthmust also be assessed, including the tetanus immuniza-tion history if any, as well as information concerningpossible allergies to medication and pre-existing health\\nproblems that may increase the risk of infection.\\nA physical examination requires careful scrutiny of\\nthe wound, with special attention to possible bone, joint,ligament, muscle, tendon, nerve, or blood-vessel damagecaused by deep punctures or severe crush injuries. Seri-ous hand injuries should be evaluated by a specializedsurgeon. Most of the time, laboratory tests for identifyingthe microorganisms in bite wounds are performed ifinfection is present. X rays and other diagnostic proce-dures may also be necessary.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 499Bites and stings\\nAn insect bite caused this person’s lower lip to swell.

Testing the blood of a person who has\\nbeen bitten for immunity to hepatitis B and other dis-eases is always necessary after a human bite. Ideally, thebiter should be tested as well for the presence of trans-missible disease. Clenched-fist injuries often requireevaluation by a hand surgeon or orthopedist. Becausemany people will deny having been in a fight, medicalprofessionals usually consider lacerations over the fourthand fifth knuckles—the typical result of a clenched-fistinjury—to be evidence of a bite wound. Medical profes-sionals also look for indications of spousal or childabuse when evaluating human bites.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. Because bites from widow spiders and\\nbrown spiders require different treatments, capturing andidentifying the spider helps to establish diagnosis.\\nSnakes\\nDiagnosis relies on a physical examination of the\\nvictim, information about the circumstances of the bite,and a look at the snake itself (if it can safely be killed andbrought in for identification). Blood tests and urinalysis\\nsupply important data on the victim’s condition. Chest x-rays and electrocardiography (a procedure for measur-\\ning heart activity) may also be necessary.\\nTreatment\\nMammals\\nDOGS. Minor dog bites can be treated at home. The\\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians recommendsgently washing the wound with soap and water and thenapplying pressure to the injured area with a clean towel\\nto stop the bleeding. The next step is to apply antibioticointment and a sterile bandage to the wound. To reduceswelling and fend off infection, ice should be applied andthe injured area kept elevated above the level of the heart.The wound should be cleaned and covered with ointmenttwice a day until it heals.\\nAny dog bite that does not stop bleeding after 15\\nminutes of pressure must be seen by a medical profes-sional. The same is true for bites that are deep or gaping;for bites to the head, hands, or feet; and for bites thatmay have broken a bone, damaged nerves, or caused amajor injury of another kind. Bite victims must alsowatch for infection. A fever is one sign of infection, asare redness, swelling, warmth, increased tenderness, andpus at the wound site. Diabetics, people with AIDS orcancer , individuals who have not had a tetanus shot in\\nfive years, and anyone else who has a medical problemthat can increase susceptibility to infection should seekmedical treatment no matter how minor the bite appears.\\nMedical treatment of dog bites involves washing the\\nwound with an anti-infective solution. Removal of deadand damaged tissue (under local, regional, or generalanesthetic) may be required after the wound has beenwashed, and any person whose tetanus shots are not up todate should receive a booster injection. Some wounds areleft open and allowed to heal on their own, while othersrequire stitches (stitching may be delayed a few days ifinfection is a concern). Many emergency departmentsprescribe antibiotics for all people with dog bites, but\\nsome researchers suggest that antibiotics are usuallyunnecessary and should be limited to those whoseinjuries or other health problems make them likely candi-dates for infection. A follow-up visit after one or twodays is generally required for anyone who has receivedbite treatment.\\nCATS. Because of the high risk of infection, people\\nwho are bitten by a cat should always see a doctor. Catscratches do not require professional medical treatmentunless the wound appears infected or the scratched per-son has a weakened immune system.\\nMedical treatment for cat bites generally follows the\\nprocedures used for dog bites. Experts advise, however,that cat-bite wounds should always be left open to pre-vent infection. Persons who have been bitten by cats gen-erally receive antibiotics as a preventive measure.\\nHUMANS. Human bites should always be examined\\nby a doctor. Such bites are usually treated with antibi-otics and left open because of the high risk of infection.A person who has been bitten may also require immu-nization against hepatitis B and other diseases.

No spider bite should be ignored. The anti-\\ndote for severe widow spider bites is a substance calledantivenin, which contains antibodies taken from theblood serum of horses injected with spider venom. Doc-tors exercise caution in using antivenin, however,\\nbecause it can trigger anaphylactic shock , a potentially\\ndeadly (though treatable) allergic reaction, and serum\\nsickness , an inflammatory response that can give rise to\\njoint pain, a fever, rashes , and other unpleasant, though\\nrarely serious, consequences.\\nAn antivenin for brown spider bites exists as well,\\nbut it is not yet available in the United States. The drugdapsone, used to treat leprosy , can sometimes stop the\\ntissue death associated with a brown spider bite. Necrot-\\nic areas may need debridement (removal of dead and\\ndamaged tissue) and skin grafts. Pain medications, anti-\\nhistamines , antibiotics, and tetanus shots are a few of the\\nother treatments that are sometimes necessary after a bitefrom a brown spider or widow spider.\\nBEES AND WASPS. Most stings can be treated at\\nhome. A stinger that is stuck in the skin can be scrapedoff with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or piece of paper(using tweezers may push more venom out of the venomsac and into the wound). The area should be cleaned andcovered with an ice pack. Aspirin and other pain med-\\nications, oral antihistamines, and calamine lotion aregood for treating minor symptoms. Putting meat tender-izer on the wound has no effect.\\nPersons who have been stung and experience an\\nallergic reaction, or who are at risk due to their medicalhistory, require immediate medical attention. The dangersigns, which usually begin 10 minutes after an individualis stung (though possibly not for several hours), includenausea, faintness, chest pain, abdominal cramps, diar-rhea, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.\\nSnakes\\nAlthough most snakes are not venomous, any\\nsnakebite should immediately be examined at a hospital.While waiting for emergency help to arrive, the victimshould wash the wound site with soap and water, andthen keep the injured area still and at a level lower thanthe heart. Ice should never be used on the wound site norshould attempts be made to suck out the venom. Makinga cut at the wound site is also dangerous. It is importantto stay calm and wait for emergency medical aid if it canarrive quickly.

The risk of a dog bite injury can be reduced\\nby avoiding sick or stray dogs, staying away from dog-fights (people often get bitten when they try to separate theanimals), and not behaving in ways that might provoke orupset dogs, such as wrestling with them or bothering themwhile they are sleeping, eating, or looking after their pup-pies. Special precautions need to be taken around infantsand young children, who must never be left alone with adog. Pit bulls, rottweilers, and German shepherds (respon-sible for nearly half of all fatal dog attacks in the UnitedStates in 1997-2000) are potentially dangerous pets inhouseholds where children live or visit. For all breeds ofdog, obedience training as well as spaying or neuteringlessen the chances of aggressive behavior.\\nCATS. Prevention involves warning children to stay\\naway from strange cats and to avoid rough play and otherbehavior that can anger cats and cause them to bite.\\nArthropods\\nSPIDERS. Common-sense precautions include clear-\\ning webs out of garages, outhouses, and other placesfavored by venomous spiders; keeping one’s hands awayfrom places where spiders may be lurking; and, whencamping or vacationing, checking clothing, shoes, andsleeping areas.\\nBEES AND WASPS. When possible, avoid the nests of\\nbees and wasps and do not eat sweet food or wear brightclothing, perfumes, or cosmetics that attract bees andwasps.\\nEmergency medical kits containing self-administra-\\nble epinephrine to counter anaphylactic shock are avail-able for allergic people and should be carried by them atall times. People who suspect they are allergic shouldconsult an allergist about shots that can reduce reactionsto bee and wasp venom.\\nSnakes\\nSnakes should not be kept as pets. Measures such as\\nmowing the lawn, keeping hedges trimmed, and remov-ing brush from the yard also discourages snakes from liv-ing close to human dwellings. Tongs should be used tomove brush, lumber, and firewood, to avoid exposingone’s hands to snakes that might be lying underneath.Similarly, golfers should never use their hands to retrievegolf balls from a water hole, since snakes can be hidingin the rocks and weeds.

Fleming Fallon, Jr., MD, PhD\\nBlack death seePlague\\nBlack lung disease\\nDefinition\\nBlack lung disease is the common name for coal\\nworkers’ pneumoconiosis (CWP) or anthracosis, alung disease of older workers in the coal industry,caused by inhalation, over many years, of smallamounts of coal dust.\\nDescription\\nThe risk of having black lung disease is directly\\nrelated to the amount of dust inhaled over the years; thedisease typically affects workers over age 50. Its com-mon name comes from the fact that the inhalation ofheavy deposits of coal dust makes miners lungs lookblack instead of a healthy pink. Although people wholive in cities often have some black deposits in theirlungs from polluted air, coal miners have much moreextensive deposits.In the years since the federal government has regu-\\nlated dust levels in coal mines, the number of cases ofblack lung disease has fallen sharply. Since the FederalCoal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, average dustlevels have fallen from 8.0 mg. per cubic meter to thecurrent standard of 2.0 mg. per cubic meter. The 1969law also set up a black lung disability benefits programto compensate coal miners who have been disabled byon-the-job dust exposure.\\nDespite the technology available to control the\\nhazard, however, miners still run the risk of develop-ing this lung disease. The risk is much lower today,however; fewer than 10% of coal miners have any xray evidence of coal dust deposits. When there is suchevidence, it often shows up as only small black spotsless than 0.4 in (1 cm). in diameter, and may havebeen caused by smoking rather than coal dust. This\\ncondition is called “simple CWP” and does not lead tosymptoms or disability.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nSince the particles of fine coal dust, which a miner\\nbreathes when he is in the mines, cannot be destroyedwithin the lungs or removed from them, builds up. Even-tually, this build-up causes thickening and scarring,making the lungs less efficient in supplying oxygen tothe blood.\\nThe primary symptom of the disease is shortness of\\nbreath , which gradually gets worse as the disease pro-\\ngresses. In severe cases, the patient may develop cor pul-\\nmonale , an enlargement and strain of the right side of the\\nheart caused by chronic lung disease. This may eventual-ly cause right-sided heart failure .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 505Black lung disease\\nA light micrograph of a human lung containing particles of\\ninspired coal dust (anthracosis).The black masses shownare groups of coal dust particles.

Othersdevelop a severe type of black lung disease called pro-gressive massive fibrosis, in which damage continues inthe upper parts of the lungs even after exposure to thedust has ended. Scientists aren’t sure what causes thisserious complication. Some think that it may be due tothe breathing of a mixture of coal and silica dust that isfound in certain mines. Silica is far more likely to lead toscarring than coal dust alone.\\nDiagnosis\\nBlack lung disease can be diagnosed by checking a\\npatient’s history for exposure to coal dust, followed by achest x-ray to discover if the characteristic spots in thelungs caused by coal dust are present.

This abnormalgrowth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.\\nDescription\\nBladder cancer is the fifth most common cancer in\\nthe United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS)estimates that in 1998, approximately 55,000 new casesof bladder cancer will be diagnosed, and it will cause atleast 12,500 deaths. The disease is three times more com-mon among men than women, and the incidence is alsohigher in caucasians.\\nThe urinary bladder is a hollow muscular organ that\\nstores urine from the kidneys until it is excreted out ofthe body. Two tubes called the ureters bring the urinefrom the kidneys to the bladder. The urethra carries theurine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\\nBladder cancer has a very high rate of recurrence.\\nEven after superficial tumors are completely removed,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 506Bladder cancerGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 506'),\n",

Hence, patients need very fre-quent and thorough follow-up care.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAlthough the exact cause of bladder cancer is not\\nknown, smokers are twice as likely as nonsmokers to getthe disease. Hence, smoking is considered the greatest\\nrisk factor for bladder cancer. Workers who are exposedto certain chemicals that are used in the dye industry andin the rubber, leather, textile, and paint industries arebelieved to be at a higher risk for bladder cancer. The dis-ease is also three times more common in men than inwomen; caucasians also are at an increased risk. The riskof bladder cancer increases with age. Most cases arefound in people who are 50–70 years old.\\nFrequent urinary infections, kidney and bladder\\nstones , and other conditions that cause long-term irrita-\\ntion to the bladder may increase the risk of getting blad-der cancer. A past history of tumors in the bladder couldalso increase one’s risk of getting other tumors.\\nOne of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is\\nblood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood in theurine to change the color of the urine to a yellow-red or adark red. At other times, the color of the urine appears nor-mal but chemical testing of the urine reveals the presenceof blood cells. A change in bladder habits such as painfulurination, increased frequency of urination and a feeling of\\nneeding to urinate but not being able to do so are some ofthe signs of possible bladder cancer. All of these symptomsmay also be caused by conditions other than cancer, but itis important to see a doctor and have the symptoms evaluat-ed. When detected early and treated appropriately, patientshave a very good chance of being cured completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf a doctor has any reason to suspect bladder cancer, he\\nmay use several tests to find out if the disease is present. Asa first step, a complete medical history will be taken tocheck for any risk factors. A thorough physical examina-\\ntion will be conducted to assess all the signs and symp-\\ntoms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample will help to ruleout the presence of a bacterial infection. In a urine cytologytest, the urine is examined under a microscope to look forany abnormal or cancerous cells. A catheter (tube) can beadvanced into the bladder through the urethra, and a saltsolution is passed through it to wash the bladder. The solu-tion can then be collected and examined under a micro-scope to check for the presence of any cancerous cells.\\nA test known as the intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is\\nan x-ray examination that is done after a dye is injectedinto the blood stream through a vein in the arm. The dyetravels through the blood stream and then reaches thekidneys to be excreted. It clearly outlines the kidneys,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 507Bladder cancer\\nUrethraEpithalial Lining\\nMuscleUreterBladder\\nCancer\\nBladder cancer on the inner lining of the bladder.

Multiple x rays are taken to\\ndetect any abnormality in the lining of these organs.\\nThe physician may use a procedure known as a cys-\\ntoscopy to view the inside of the bladder. A thin hollow\\nlighted tube is introduced into the bladder through theurethra. If any suspicious looking masses are seen, asmall piece of the tissue can be removed from it using apair of biopsy forceps. The tissue is then examinedmicroscopically to verify if cancer is present, and if so, toidentify the type of cancer.\\nIf cancer is detected and there is evidence to indicate\\nthat it has metastasized (spread) to distant sites in the body,imaging tests such as chest x rays, computed tomography\\nscans (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may\\nbe done to determine which organs are affected. Bladdercancer generally tends to spread to the lungs, liver, and bone.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage\\nof the tumor. The patient’s medical history, overall healthstatus, and personal preferences are also taken intoaccount when deciding on an appropriate treatment plan.The three standard modes of treatment that are availablefor bladder cancer are surgery, radiation therapy , and\\nchemotherapy . In addition, newer treatment methods\\nsuch as photodynamic therapy and immunotherapy arealso being investigated in clinical trials.\\nSurgery is considered an option only when the disease\\nis in its early stages. If the tumor is localized to a small areaand has not spread to the inner layers of the bladder, thenthe surgery is done without cutting open the abdomen. Acytoscope is introduced into the bladder through the ure-thra, and the tumor is removed through it. This procedure iscalled a transurethral resection (TUR). Passing a high-ener-gy laser beam through the cytoscope and burning the can-cer may treat any remaining cancer. This procedure isknown as electrofulguration. If the cancer has invaded thewalls of the bladder, surgery will be done through an inci-sion in the abdomen. Cancer that is not very large can beremoved by partial cystectomy , a procedure where a part\\nof the bladder is removed. If the cancer is large or is presentin more than one area of the bladder, a radical cystectomyis done. In this operation, besides the entire bladder, theadjoining organs may also be removed. In men, the prostateis removed, while in women, the uterus, ovaries, and fal-lopian tubes are removed.\\nIf the entire urinary bladder is removed, then an alter-\\nnate storage place must be created for the urine to bestored before it is excreted out of the body. To do this, apiece of intestine is converted into a small bag andattached to the ureters. This is then connected to an open-ing (stoma) that is made in the abdominal wall. The proce-\\ndure is called a urostomy. In some urostomy procedures,the urine from the intestinal sac is routed into a bag that isplaced over the stoma in the abdominal wall. The bag ishidden by the clothing and has to be emptied occasionallyby the patient. In a different procedure, the urine is collect-ed in the intestinal sac, but there is no bag on the outside ofthe abdomen. The intestinal sac has to be emptied by thepatient, by placing a drainage tube through the stoma.\\nRadiation therapy that uses high-energy rays to kill\\ncancer cells is generally used after surgery to destroy anyremaining cancer cells that may not have been removedduring surgery. If the tumor is in a location that makessurgery difficult, or if it is large, radiation may be usedbefore surgery to shrink the tumor. In cases of advancedbladder cancer, radiation therapy is used to ease thesymptoms such as pain , bleeding, or blockage. Radiation\\ncan be delivered by external beam radiation where asource of radiation that is outside the body focuses theradiation on the area of the tumor. Occasionally, a smallpellet of radioactive material may be placed directly intothe cancer. This is known as interstitial radiation therapy.\\nChemotherapy uses anticancer drugs to destroy the\\ncancer cells that may have migrated to distant sites. Thedrugs are introduced into the bloodstream by injecting theminto a vein in the arm or taking them orally in pill form.Generally a combination of drugs is more effective than anysingle drug in treating bladder cancer. Chemotherapy maybe given following surgery to kill any remaining cancercells. It may also be given even when no remaining cancercells can be seen. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.Anticancer drugs, including thiotepa, doxorubicin, and mit-omycin, may also be instilled directly into the bladder(intravesicular chemotherapy) to treat superficial tumors.\\nImmunotherapy or biological therapy, uses the\\nbody’s own immune cells to fight the disease. To treatsuperficial bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-Guerin(BCG) may be instilled directly into the bladder. BCG isa weakened (attenuated) strain of the tuberculosis bacil-\\nlus that stimulates the body’s immune system to fight thecancer. This therapy has been shown to be effective incontrolling superficial bladder cancer.\\nPhotodynamic treatment is a novel mode of treat-\\nment that uses special chemicals and light to kill the can-cerous cells. First, a drug is introduced into the bladderthat makes the cancer cells more susceptible to light. Fol-lowing that, a special light is shone on the bladder in anattempt to destroy the cancerous cells.\\nPrognosis\\nWhen detected at the early stages, the prognosis for\\nbladder cancer is excellent.

These types of stones are much less common thankidney stones .\\nDescription\\nBladder stones can form anywhere in the urinary\\ntract before depositing in the bladder. They begin as tinygranules about the size of a grain of sand, but they cangrow to more than an inch in diameter. These stones canblock the flow of urine causing pain and difficulty with\\nurination. They can also scratch the bladder wall, whichmay lead to bleeding or infection.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWhile the exact causes of the formation of bladder\\nstones are not completely understood, bladder stonesusually occur because of urinary tract infection (UTI),obstruction of the urinary tract, enlargement of theprostate gland in men, or the presence of foreign bodiesin the urinary tract. Diet and the amount of fluid intakealso appear to be important factors in the development ofbladder stones.\\nNinety-five percent of all bladder stones occur in\\nmen, most of who have an enlarged prostate gland or a\\nUTI. These stones are rarely seen in children or inAfrican Americans. People with gout may develop blad-\\nder stones composed almost entirely of uric acid.\\nThe symptoms of bladder stones may become evi-\\ndent when the wall of the bladder is scratched or whenthe urinary tract becomes obstructed by the stone. Thesesymptoms include:\\n• abnormally dark colored urine\\n• blood in the urine• difficulty urinating\\n• frequent urge to urinate\\n• lower abdominal pain• pain or discomfort in the penis\\nSome people with bladder stones also may experi-\\nence an inability to control urination ( urinary inconti-\\nnence ).\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of bladder stones is usually made after a\\nphysical examination , which may include a rectal exami-\\nnation to check for enlargement of the prostate gland.\\nUrine tests are then used to determine if there is blood orindications of an UTI in the urine. If bladder stones are sus-pected, bladder or pelvic x rays may be ordered. Stones thatare large enough to cause problems with urinary functionare almost always detectable by x ray.\\nTreatment\\nMany bladder stones can be passed out of the body\\nin the urine. People with small bladder stones will beasked to increase their fluid intakes to at least six to eighteight-ounce glasses of water per day to increase urinaryoutput. If the stones do not pass after two weeks, or if the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 510Bladder stonesGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 510'),\n",

These smallerstones may then pass in the urine. Stones that cannot bebroken into pieces by these methods, or that the patientcannot pass, may have to be surgically removed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nTraditional herbal remedies for bladder stones include\\ncelery seed and horsetail. Also, because incomplete blad-der emptying may cause bladder stones, many patientsmay benefit from methods and remedies aimed at improv-ing overall bladder function. These include Kegel exercis-es, which are used to strengthen the muscles involved inurination; herbal supplements (cornsilk, hydrangea,juniper berries, parsley, and uva ursi) used to increaseurine flow and flush out sediment from the bladder; and,the consumption of cranberry juice and/or fresh, unsweet-ened, lemon juice. Cranberry juice helps to control urinarytract infection and contains a chemical that coats the wallsof the bladder, making them more resistant to infection.Lemon juice helps to flush out the urinary system.\\nPrognosis\\nMost bladder stones can be, and are, passed out of\\nthe body in the urine without any permanent damage tothe bladder or the rest of the urinary tract. However, mostbladder stones arise from an underlying medical condi-tion. Therefore, if this medical condition is not correctedapproximately half of all patients will experience a recur-rence of bladder stones within five years.\\nPrevention\\nBladder stones may, in some cases, be prevented by\\nthe patient receiving prompt medical treatment for anenlarged prostate gland or UTI.

Blastomycosis may be limited\\nto the lungs or also involve the skin and bones. In itsmost severe form, the infection can spread throughoutthe body and involve many organ systems (systemic).\\nDescription\\nBlastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blas-\\ntomyces dermatitidis . Although primarily an airborne\\ndisease, farmers and gardeners may become infectedfrom contact with spores in the soil through cuts andscrapes. The fungus that causes the disease is found inmoist soil and wood in the southeastern United States,the Mississippi River valley, southern Canada, and Cen-tral America.

Canine blastomycosis, a common dog disease, iscaused by the same fungus that infects humans. Howev-er, people do not get this disease from their dogs exceptonly very rarely through dog bites.\\nBlastomycosis is a rare disease infecting only about\\n4 in every 100,000 people. It is at least six times morecommon in men than in women and tends to more ofteninfect children and individuals in the 30–50 year old agegroup. People who have diabetes mellitus or who are\\ntaking drugs that suppress the immune system (immuno-compromised) are more likely to develop blastomycosis.Although people with AIDS can get blastomycosis\\nbecause of their weakened immune system, blastomyco-sis has not been one of the more common fungal infec-tions associated with AIDS.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nOnce inhaled, the spores of B. dermatitidis can lodge\\nin the lungs and cause a localized inflammation. This isknown as primary pulmonary blastomycosis. The diseasedoes not spread from one person to another. In the earlystages, symptoms may include a dry cough ,fever , heavy\\nsweating, fatigue , and a general feeling of ill health. In\\napproximately 25% of blastomycosis cases, only thelungs are affected. As the disease progresses, smalllesions form in the lungs causing the air sacs deep withinthe lungs (alveoli) to break down and form small cavities.\\nIn another 35%, the disease involves both the lungs\\nand the skin. Bumps develop on the skin, graduallybecoming small, white, crusted blisters filled with pus.The blisters break open, creating abscesses that do notheal. Approximately 19% of infected people have skinsores without infection in the lungs.\\nThe remaining approximately 20% of the infected\\npopulation has blastomycosis that has spread or dissemi-nated to other systems of the body. Symptoms mayinclude pain and lesions on one or more bones, the male\\ngenitalia, and/or parts of the central nervous system. Theliver, spleen, lymph nodes, heart, adrenal glands, anddigestive system may also be infected.\\nDiagnosis\\nA positive diagnosis of blastomycosis is made when\\nthe fungus B. dermatitidis is identified by direct micro-\\nscopic examination of body fluids such as sputum andprostate fluid or in tissue samples (biopsies) from thelung or skin. Another way to diagnose blastomycosis is\\nto culture and isolate the fungus from a sample of spu-tum. Chest x rays are used to assess lung damage, butalone cannot lead to a definitive diagnosis of blastomy-cosis because any damage caused by other diseases, suchas by pneumonia or tuberculosis , may appear look on\\nthe x ray. Because its symptoms vary widely, blastomy-cosis is often misdiagnosed.\\nTreatment\\nBlastomycosis must be treated or it will gradually\\nlead to death . Treatment with the fungicidal drug keto-\\nconazole (Nizoral) taken orally is effective in about 75%of patients. Amphotericin B (Fungizone) given intra-venously is also very effective, but it has more toxic sideeffects than ketoconazole. Treatment with amphotericinB usually requires hospitalization, and the patient mayalso receive other drugs to minimize the its side effects.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatment for fungal infections focuses\\non creating an internal environment where the funguscannot survive. This is accomplished by eating a diet lowin dairy products, sugars, including honey and fruit juice,and foods like beer that contain yeast. This is comple-mented by a diet consisting, in large part, of uncookedand unprocessed foods. Supplements of vitamins C, E,\\nA-plus, and B complex may also be useful. Lactobacillus\\nacidophilus and Bifidobacterium will replenish the good\\nbacteria in the intestines. Some antifungal herbs, likegarlic ( Allium sativum ), can be consumed in relatively\\nlarge doses and for an extended period of time in order toincrease effectiveness.

It indicates how well plateletsinteract with blood vessel walls to form blood clots.\\nPurpose\\nBleeding time is used most often to detect qualitative\\ndefects of platelets, such as V on Willebrand’s disease. Thetest helps identify people who have defects in theirplatelet function. This is the ability of blood to clot fol-lowing a wound or trauma. Normally, platelets interactwith the walls of blood vessels to cause a blood clot.There are many factors in the clotting mechanism, andthey are initiated by platelets. The bleeding time test isusually used on patients who have a history of prolongedbleeding after cuts, or who have a family history of bleed-ing disorders. Also, the bleeding time test is sometimesperformed as a preoperative test to determine a patient’slikely bleeding response during and after surgery. Howev-er, in patients with no history of bleeding problems, orwho are not taking anti-inflammatory drugs, the bleedingtime test is not usually necessary.\\nPrecautions\\nBefore administering the test, patients should be\\nquestioned about what medications they may be taking.Some medications will adversely affect the results of thebleeding time test. These medications include anticoagu-lants, diuretics ,anticancer drugs ,sulfonamides , thi-\\nazide, aspirin and aspirin-containing preparations, and\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . The test may\\nalso be affected by anemia (a deficiency in red bloodcells). Since the taking of aspirin or related drugs are themost common cause of prolonged bleeding time, noaspirin should be taken two weeks prior to the test.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 514Bleeding timeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 514'),\n",

The Ivy method is the traditional format for thistest. In the Ivy method, a blood pressure cuff is placedon the upper arm and inflated to 40 mM Hg. A lancet orscalpel blade is used to make a stab wound on theunderside of the forearm. An automatic, spring-loadedblade device is most commonly used to make a stan-dard-sized cut. The area stabbed is selected so that nosuperficial or visible veins are cut. These veins, becauseof their size, may have longer bleeding times, especial-ly in people with bleeding defects. The time from whenthe stab wound is made until all bleeding has stopped ismeasured and is called the bleeding time. Every 30 sec-onds, filter paper or a paper towel is used to draw offthe blood. The test is finished when bleeding hasstopped completely.\\nThe three other methods of performing the bleeding\\ntest are the template, modified template, and Dukemethods. The template and modified template methodsare variations of the Ivy method. A blood pressure cuffis used and the skin on the forearm prepared as in theIvy method. A template is placed over the area to bestabbed and two incisions are made in the forearm usingthe template as a location guide. The main differencebetween the template and the modified method is thelength of the cut made.\\nFor the Duke method, a nick is made in an ear lobe\\nor a fingertip is pricked to cause bleeding. As in the Ivymethod, the test is timed from the start of bleeding untilbleeding is completely stopped. The disadvantage to theDuke method is that the pressure on the blood veins inthe stab area is not constant and the results achieved areless reliable. The advantage to the Duke method is thatno scar remains after the test. The other methods mayresult in a tiny, hairline scar where the wound was made.However, this is largely a cosmetic concern.\\nPreparation\\nThere is no special preparation required of the\\npatient for this test. The area to be stabbed should bewiped clean with an alcohol pad. The alcohol should beleft on the skin long enough for it to kill bacteria at thewound site. The alcohol must be removed before stab-bing the arm because alcohol will adversely affect thetests results by inhibiting clotting.\\nAftercare\\nIf a prolonged bleeding time is caused by unknown\\nfactors or diseases, further testing is required to identifythe exact cause of the bleeding problem.KEY TERMS\\nHemostasis —The stopping of bleeding or blood\\nflow through a blood vessel or organ.\\nNormal results\\nA normal bleeding time for the Ivy method is less\\nthan five minutes from the time of the stab until allbleeding from the wound stops. Some texts extend thenormal range to eight minutes. Normal values for thetemplate method range up to eight minutes, while forthe modified template methods, up to 10 minutes isconsidered normal. Normal for the Duke method isthree minutes.\\nAbnormal results\\nA bleeding time that is longer than normal is an\\nabnormal result. The test should be stopped if the patienthasn’t stopped bleeding by 20-30 minutes. Bleeding timeis longer when the normal function of platelets isimpaired, or there are a lower-than-normal number ofplatelets in the blood.\\nA longer-than-normal bleeding time can indicate\\nthat one of several defects in hemostasis is present,including severe thrombocytopenia , platelet dysfunc-\\ntion, vascular defects, V on Willebrand’s disease, or otherabnormalities.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHenry, J.

The goal is to provide a moreyouthful appearance.\\nThe surgeon will begin by deciding whether excess\\nskin, fat deposits, or muscle looseness are at fault. Whilethe patient is sitting upright, the surgeon will mark on theskin where incisions will be made. Care will be taken tohide the incision lines in the natural skin folds above andbelow the eye. The patient then receives injections of alocal anesthetic to numb the pain. Many surgeons also give\\nthe patient a sedative intravenously during the procedure.\\nAfter a small, crescent-shaped section of eyelid skin\\nis removed, the surgeon will work to tease out smallpockets of fat that have collected in the lids. If musclelooseness is also a problem, the surgeon may trim tissueor add a stitch to pull it tighter. Then the incision isclosed with stitches.\\nIn some patients, fat deposits in the lower eyelid may\\nbe the only or primary problem. Such patients may begood candidates for transconjunctival blepharoplasty. Inthis procedure the surgeon makes no incision on the sur-face of the eyelid, but instead enters from behind to teaseout the fat deposits from a small incision. The advantageof this procedure is that there is no visible scar.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to surgery, patients meet with their surgeon to\\ndiscuss the procedure, clarify the results that can beachieved, and discuss the potential problems that mightoccur. Having realistic expectations is important in anycosmetic procedure. Patients will learn, for example, thatalthough blepharoplasty can improve the appearance ofthe eyelid, other procedures, such as a chemical peel,will be necessary to reduce the appearance of wrinklesaround the eye. Some surgeons prescribe vitamin C andvitamin K for 10 days prior to surgery in the belief thatthis helps the healing process.

Ice-\\ncold compresses are applied to the eyes continuously forthe first day following surgery, and several times a day forthe next week or so, to reduce swelling. Some swellingand discoloration around the eyes is expected with theprocedure. Patients should avoid aspirin or alcoholic bev-erages for one week and should limit their activities,including bending, straining, and lifting. The stitches areremoved a few days after surgery. Patients can generallyreturn to their usual activities within a week to 10 days.\\nRisks\\nAs with any surgical procedure, blepharoplasty can\\nlead to infection and scarring. Good care of the wound fol-lowing surgery can minimize these risks. In cases wheretoo much skin is removed from the eyelids, the patientmay have difficulty closing his eyes. Dry eye syndromemay develop, requiring the use of artificial tears to lubri-cate the eye. In a rare complication, called retrobulbarhematoma, a pocket of blood forms behind the eyeball.\\nNormal results\\nMost patients can expect good results from blepharo-\\nplasty, with the removal of excess eyelid skin and fat pro-ducing a more youthful appearance. Some swelling anddiscoloration is expected immediately following the pro-cedure, but this clears in time. Small scars will be leftwhere the surgeon has made incisions; but these generallylighten in appearance over several months, and, if placedcorrectly, will not be readily noticeable.\\nAbnormal results\\nAs noted, if too much excess skin is removed from\\nthe upper eyelid, the patient may be unable to close hiseyes completely; another surgery to correct the defectmay be required. Similarly, too much skin can beremoved from the lower eyelid, allowing too much of thewhite of the eye (the sclera) to show. In extreme cases,the lower lid may be pulled down too far, revealing theunderlying tissue. Called an ectropion, this, too, mayrequire a second, corrective surgery. The eye’s ability tomake tears may also be compromised, leading to dry eyesyndrome. Dry eye syndrome is potentially dangerous; inrare cases it leads to damage to the cornea of the eye andvision loss.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAsken, Saul. “Blepharoplasty.” In Cosmetic Surgery of the\\nSkin: Principles and Techniques , ed.

It involves determiningthe numbers, concentrations, and conditions of the differ-ent types of blood cells.\\nPurpose\\nThe CBC is a useful screening and diagnostic test\\nthat is often done as part of a routine physical examina-\\ntion. It can provide valuable information about the blood\\nand blood-forming tissues (especially the bone marrow),as well as other body systems. Abnormal results can indi-cate the presence of a variety of conditions—includinganemias , leukemias, and infections—sometimes before\\nthe patient experiences symptoms of the disease.\\nDescription\\nA complete blood count is actually a series of tests\\nin which the numbers of red blood cells, white bloodcells, and platelets in a given volume of blood are count-ed. The CBC also measures the hemoglobin content andthe packed cell volume ( hematocrit ) of the red blood\\ncells, assesses the size and shape of the red blood cells,and determines the types and percentages of white bloodcells. Components of the complete blood count (hemo-globin, hematocrit, white blood cells, platelets, etc.) canalso be tested separately, and are sometimes done thatway when a doctor wants to monitor a specific condition,such as the white cell count of a patient diagnosed withleukemia, or the hemoglobin of a patient who has recent-ly received a blood transfusion . Because of its value,\\nthough, as an indicator of a person’s overall health, theCBC package is most frequently ordered.\\nThe blood count is performed relatively inexpen-\\nsively and quickly. Most laboratories routinely use sometype of automated equipment to dilute the blood, samplea measured volume of the diluted suspension, and countthe cells in that volume. In addition to counting actualnumbers of red cells, white cells, and platelets, the auto-mated cell counters also measure the hemoglobin andcalculate the hematocrit and the red blood cell indices\\n(measures of the size and hemoglobin content of the redblood cells). Technologists then examine a stained bloodsmear under the microscope to identify any abnormali-ties in the appearance of the red blood cells and to reportthe types and percentages of white blood cells observed.The red blood cell (RBC) count determines the total\\nnumber of red cells (erythrocytes) in a sample of blood.The red cells, the most numerous of the cellular ele-ments, carry oxygen from the lungs to the body’s tissues.Hemoglobin (Hgb) is the protein-iron compound in thered blood cells that enables them to transport oxygen. Itsconcentration corresponds closely to the RBC count.Also closely tied to the RBC and hemoglobin values isthe hematocrit (Hct), which measures the percentage ofred blood cells in the total blood volume. The hematocrit(expressed as percentage points) is normally about threetimes the hemoglobin concentration (reported as gramsper deciliter).\\nRed blood cell indices provide information about the\\nsize and hemoglobin content of the red cells. They areuseful in differentiating types of anemias. The indicesinclude four measurements that are calculated using theRBC count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit results. Meancorpuscular volume (MCV) is a measurement of the aver-age size of the red blood cells and indicates whether thatis small, large or normal. The red blood cell distributionwidth (RDW) is an indication of the variation in RBCsize. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) measures theaverage amount (weight) of hemoglobin within a redblood cell. A similar measurement, mean corpuscularhemoglobin concentration (MCHC), expresses the aver-age concentration of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.\\nThe white blood cell (WBC) count determines the\\ntotal number of white cells (leukocytes) in the blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 521Blood count\\nA white blood cell.

Fewer in number than the red cells, WBCs are\\nthe body’s primary means of fighting infection. There arefive main types of white cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes,monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils), each of whichplays a different role in responding to the presence offoreign organisms in the body. A differential white cellcount is done by staining a smear of the patient’s bloodwith a Wright’s stain, allowing the different types ofwhite cells to be clearly seen under the microscope. Atechnologist then counts a minimum of 100 WBCs andreports each type of white cell as a percentage of the totalwhite blood cells counted.\\nThe platelet count is an actual count of the number\\nof platelets (thrombocytes) in a given volume of blood.Platelets, the smallest of the cellular elements of blood,are involved in blood clotting. Because platelets canclump together, the automated counting method is sub-ject to a certain level of error and may not be accurateenough for low platelet counts. For this reason, very lowplatelet levels are often counted manually.\\nNormal results\\nBlood count values can vary by age and sex. The\\nnormal red blood cell count ranges from 4.2–5.4 millionRBCs per microliter of blood for men and 3.6–5.0 mil-lion for women. Hemoglobin values range from 14–18grams per deciliter of blood for men and 12–16 grams forwomen. The normal hematocrit is 42–54% for men and36–48% for women. The normal number of white bloodcells for both men and women is approximately4,000–10,000 WBCs per microliter of blood.\\nAbnormal results\\nAbnormal blood count results are seen in a variety of\\nconditions. One of the most common is anemias, whichare characterized by low RBC counts, hemoglobins, andhematocrits.

Blood\\nis drawn from the person one or more times and is testedin a laboratory to find and identify any microorganismpresent and growing in the blood. If a microorganism isfound, more testing is done to determine the antibiotics\\nthat will be effective in treating the infection.\\nPurpose\\nBacteremia is a serious clinical condition and can\\nlead to death . To give the best chance for effective treat-\\nment and survival, a blood culture is done as soon as aninfection is suspected.\\nSymptoms of bacteremia are fever , chills, mental\\nconfusion, anxiety , rapid heart beat, hyperventilation,\\nblood clotting problems, and shock . These symptoms are\\nespecially significant in a person who already has anoth-er illness or infection, is hospitalized, or has troublefighting infections because of a weak immune system.Often, the blood infection results from an infectionsomewhere else in the body that has now spread.\\nAdditionally, blood cultures are done to find the\\ncauses of other infections. These include bacterial pneu-\\nmonia (an infection of the lung), and infectious endo-\\ncarditis (an infection of the inner layer of the heart).\\nBoth of these infections leak bacteria into the blood.\\nAfter a blood infection has been diagnosed, con-\\nfirmed by culture, and treated, an additional blood cul-ture may be done to make sure the infection is gone.\\nDescription\\nCulture strategies\\nThere are many variables involved in performing a\\nblood culture. Before the person’s blood is drawn, thephysician must make several decisions based on a knowl-edge of infections and the person’s clinical condition andmedical history.\\nSeveral groups of microorganisms, including bacte-\\nria, viruses, mold, and yeast, can cause blood infections.The bacteria group can be further broken down into aer-obes and anaerobes. Most aerobes do not need oxygen tolive. They can grow with oxygen (aerobic microbes) orwithout oxygen (anaerobic microbes).\\nBased on the clinical condition of the patient, the\\nphysician determines what group of microorganisms islikely to be causing the infection and then orders one or\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 522Blood cultureGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 522'),\n",

Eachspecific type of culture is handled differently by the labo-ratory. Most blood cultures test for both aerobic andanaerobic microbes. Fungal, viral, and mycobacterialblood cultures can also be done, but are less common.\\nThe physician must also decide how many blood\\ncultures should be done. One culture is rarely enough,but two to three are usually adequate. Four cultures areoccasionally required. Some factors influencing thisdecision are the specific microorganisms the physicianexpects to find based on the person’s symptoms or previ-ous culture results, and whether or not the person has hadrecent antibiotic therapy.\\nThe time at which the cultures are to be drawn is\\nanother decision made by the physician. During mostblood infections (called intermittent bacteremia) microor-ganisms enter the blood at various time intervals. Blooddrawn randomly may miss the microorganisms. Sincemicroorganisms enter the blood 30–90 minutes before theperson’s fever spikes, collecting the culture just after thefever spike offers the best likelihood of finding themicroorganism. The second and third cultures may becollected at the same time, but from different places onthe person, or spaced at 30-minute or one-hour intervals,as the physician chooses. During continuous bacteremia,such as infective endocarditis, microorganisms are alwaysin the blood and the timing of culture collection is lessimportant. Blood cultures should always be collectedbefore antibiotic treatment has begun.\\nLaboratory analysis\\nBacteria are the most common microorganisms\\nfound in blood infections. Laboratory analysis of a bacte-rial blood culture differs slightly from that of a fungalculture and significantly from that of a viral culture.\\nBlood is drawn from a person and put directly into a\\nblood culture bottle containing a nutritional broth. Afterthe laboratory receives the blood culture bottle, severalprocesses must be completed:\\n• provide an environment for the bacteria to grow• detect the growth when it occurs• identify the bacteria that grow• test the bacteria against certain antibiotics to determine\\nwhich antibiotic will be effective\\nThere are several types of systems, both manual and\\nautomated, available to laboratories to carry out theseprocesses.\\nThe broth in the blood culture bottle is the first step\\nin creating an environment in which bacteria will grow. Itcontains all the nutrients that bacteria need to grow. If the\\nphysician expects anaerobic bacteria to grow, oxygenwill be kept out of the blood culture bottle; if aerobes areexpected, oxygen will be allowed in the bottle.\\nThe bottles are placed in an incubator and kept at\\nbody temperature. They are watched daily for signs ofgrowth, including cloudiness or a color change in thebroth, gas bubbles, or clumps of bacteria. When there isevidence of growth, the laboratory does a gram stain anda subculture. To do the gram stain, a drop of blood isremoved from the bottle and placed on a microscopeslide. The blood is allowed to dry and then is stained withpurple and red stains and examined under the micro-scope. If bacteria are seen, the color of stain they pickedup (purple or red), their shape (such as round or rectan-gular), and their size provide valuable clues as to whattype of microorganism they are and what antibioticsmight work best. To do the subculture, a drop of blood isplaced on a culture plate, spread over the surface, andplaced in an incubator.\\nIf there is no immediate visible evidence of growth\\nin the bottles, the laboratory looks for bacteria by doinggram stains and subcultures. These steps are repeateddaily for the first several days and periodically after that.\\nWhen bacteria grows, the laboratory identifies it\\nusing biochemical tests and the gram stain. Sensitivitytesting, also called antibiotic susceptibility testing, is alsodone. The bacteria are tested against many differentantibiotics to see which antibiotics can effectively kill it.\\nAll information is passed on to the physician as soon\\nas it is known. An early report, known as a preliminaryreport, is usually available after one day. This report willtell if any bacteria have been found yet, and if so, theresults of the gram stain. The next preliminary report mayinclude a description of the bacteria growing on the sub-culture. The laboratory notifies the physician immediatelywhen an organism is found and as soon as sensitivity testsare complete. Sensitivity tests may be complete before thebacteria is completely identified. The final report may notbe available for five to seven days. If bacteria was found,the report will include its complete identification and alist of the antibiotics to which the bacteria is sensitive.\\nOne automated system is considered one of the most\\nimportant recent technical advances in blood cultures. Itis called continuous-monitoring blood culture systems(CMCCS). The instruments automatically monitor thebottles containing the patient blood for evidence ofmicroorganisms, usually every 10 minutes. Many datapoints are collected daily for each bottle, and fed into acomputer for analysis. Sophisticated mathematical calcu-lations can determine when microorganisms have grown.This, combined with more frequent blood tests, make it\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 523Blood cultureGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 523'),\n",

In addition,\\nall CMBCS instruments have the detection system, incu-bator, and agitation unit in one unit.\\nPreparation\\nTen ml (milliliter) of blood is usually needed for\\neach blood culture bottle. First a healthcare workerlocates a vein in the inner elbow region. The area of skinwhere the blood will be drawn must be disinfected toprevent any microorganisms on a person’s skin fromentering the blood culture bottle and contaminating it.The area is disinfected by wiping the area with alcohol ina circular fashion, starting with tiny circles at the spotwhere the needle will puncture the skin and enlarging thesize of the circles while wiping away from the puncturesite. The same pattern of wiping is repeated using aniodine or iodophor solution. The top of the bottle is disin-fected using alcohol. After the person’s skin has beendisinfected, the healthcare worker draws the blood andabout 10 ml of blood is injected into each blood culturebottle. The type of bottles used will vary based onwhether the physician is looking for bacteria (aerobes oranaerobes), yeast, mold, or viruses.\\nAftercare\\nDiscomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture\\nsite or the person may feel dizzy or faint.

In true bacteremia, thepatient’s clinical condition should be consistent with ablood infection caused by the microorganism that wasfound. The microorganism is usually found in more thanone culture, it usually grows soon after the bottles areincubated, and it is often the cause of an infection some-where else in the person’s body.\\nWhen the culture is positive because of contamina-\\ntion, the patient’s clinical condition usually is not consis-tent with an infection from the identified microorganism.In addition, the microorganism is often one commonlyfound on skin, it rarely causes infection, it is found inonly one bottle, and it may appear after several days ofincubation.

People preparing for elective surgerymay donate their own blood to be held and then returnedto them during surgery. This is known as autologousblood donation. Directed donor blood has been donatedby someone known to the intended recipient, such as afamily member or friend.\\nEach year, more than four million Americans receive\\nblood transfusions involving more than 26 million unitsof blood (one unit equals 450 milliliters, or about onepint), or an average of about 32,000 units per day. All ofthat blood must be collected, tested, prepared, stored, anddelivered to the appropriate sites. Roughly eight millionpeople in the United States donate blood each year; abouthalf of the total amount needed is provided by the 36regional blood centers of the American Red Cross.\\nWhole blood and the various blood components have\\nmany uses. Red blood cells, which carry oxygen, are usedto treat anemia. Platelets, which play a role in controllingbleeding, are commonly used in the treatment ofleukemia and other cancers. Fresh frozen plasma is alsoused to control bleeding in people deficient in certainclotting factors. Cryoprecipitated AHF, made from freshfrozen plasma, contains a few specific clotting factors.\\nPrecautions\\nTo ensure the safety of the blood supply, a multi-\\ntiered process of donor screening and deferral isemployed. This involves donor education, taking adetailed health history of each prospective donor, andgiving potential donors a simple physical examination\\n(which includes taking a few drops of blood to test foranemia). At any point in the process, a potential donormay be “deferred,” or judged ineligible to donate blood.This deferral may be temporary or permanent, dependingon the reason. Potential donors are also encouraged to“self-defer,” or voluntarily decline to donate, rather thanput future blood recipients at risk.\\nAll donated blood is extensively tested before being\\nused. The first step is determining the blood type, whichindicates who can receive the blood. Receiving the wrongtype of blood can cause death . Blood is also screened for\\nany antibodies that could cause complications for recipi-ents. In addition, blood is tested to screen out donors\\ninfected with the following diseases: Hepatitis B surface\\nantigen ADD, hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C virus\\nantibody, HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody, HIV p24 antigen,HTLV-I and HTLV-II antibodies, and syphilis . Nucleic\\nAcid Amplification testing is also performed, and othertests may be done if a doctor requests them.\\nIn order to detect the greatest possible number of\\ninfections, these screening tests are extremely sensitive.For this reason, however, donors sometimes receive falsepositive test results. In these cases, more specific confir-matory tests are performed, to help rule out false positiveresults. Blood found to be abnormal is discarded, and allitems coming into direct contact with donors are usedonly once and then discarded. Donors of infected bloodare entered into the Donor Deferral Register, a confiden-tial national data base used to prevent deferred peoplefrom donating blood.\\nIn general, blood donors must be at least 17 years\\nold (some states allow younger people to donate bloodwith their parents’ consent), must weigh at least 110pounds (50 kg), and must be in good health.\\nMany factors can temporarily or permanently dis-\\nqualify potential donors. Most of them have to do withhaving engaged in behaviors that put them at risk ofinfection or having spent time in certain specified areas.Among these factors are having had a tattoo, having hadsex with people in high-risk groups, having had certaindiseases, and having been raped.\\nDescription\\nThere are eight different blood types in all—four\\nABO groups, each of which may be either Rh positive orRh negative. These types, and their approximate distribu-tion in the U.S. population, are as follows: O+ (38%), O-(7%), A+ (34%), A- (6%), B+ (9%), B- (2%), AB+ (3%),AB- (1%). In an emergency, anyone can safely receivetype O red blood cells, and people with this blood type areknown as “universal donors. “ People with type AB blood,known as “universal recipients,” can receive any type ofred blood cells and can give plasma to all blood types.\\nBlood donations can be made in community blood\\ncenters, at hospitals or in bloodmobiles, which visitschools, churches and workplaces. The actual process ofdonating whole blood takes about 20 minutes. A sterileneedle is inserted into a vein in the donor’s arm. Theblood flows through plastic tubing into a blood bag.Donors may be asked to clench their fist to encourageblood to flow. Usually, one unit of blood is collected.Afterward, donors are escorted to an observation area,given light refreshments, and allowed to rest.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 525Blood donation and registryGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 525'),\n",

Thetest also indicates how well the lungs and kidneys areinteracting to maintain normal blood pH (acid-base bal-ance). Blood gas studies are usually done to assess respi-ratory disease and other conditions that may affect thelungs, and to manage patients receiving oxygen therapy(respiratory therapy). In addition, the acid-base compo-nent of the test provides information on kidney function.\\nDescription\\nBlood gas analysis is performed on blood from an\\nartery. It measures the partial pressures of oxygen andcarbon dioxide in the blood, as well as oxygen content,oxygen saturation, bicarbonate content, and blood pH.\\nOxygen in the lungs is carried to the tissues through\\nthe bloodstream, but only a small amount of this oxygencan actually dissolve in arterial blood. How much dis-solves depends on the partial pressure of the oxygen (thepressure that the gas exerts on the walls of the arteries).Therefore, testing the partial pressure of oxygen is actu-ally measuring how much oxygen the lungs are deliver-ing to the blood. Carbon dioxide is released into theblood as a by-product of cell metabolism. The partialcarbon dioxide pressure indicates how well the lungs areeliminating this carbon dioxide.\\nThe remainder of oxygen that is not dissolved in the\\nblood combines with hemoglobin, a protein—iron com-pound found in the red blood cells. The oxygen contentmeasurement in an ABG analysis indicates how muchoxygen is combined with the hemoglobin. A relatedvalue is the oxygen saturation, which compares theamount of oxygen actually combined with hemoglobin tothe total amount of oxygen that the hemoglobin is capa-ble of combining with.\\nCarbon dioxide dissolves more readily in the blood\\nthan oxygen does, primarily forming bicarbonate andsmaller amounts of carbonic acid. When present in nor-mal amounts, the ratio of carbonic acid to bicarbonatecreates an acid-base balance in the blood, helping to keepthe pH at a level where the body’s cellular functions aremost efficient. The lungs and kidneys both participate inmaintaining the carbonic acid-bicarbonate balance. Thelungs control the carbonic acid level and the kidneys reg-ulate the bicarbonate. If either organ is not functioningproperly, an acid-base imbalance can result. Determina-tion of bicarbonate and pH levels, then, aids in diagnos-ing the cause of abnormal blood gas values.\\nThe procedure\\nThe blood sample is obtained by arterial puncture (usu-\\nally in the wrist, although it could be in the groin or arm) orfrom an arterial line already in place. If a puncture is need-ed, the skin over the artery is cleaned with an antiseptic. Atechnician then collects the blood with a small sterile needleattached to a disposable syringe. The patient may feel abrief throbbing or cramping at the site of the puncture. Afterthe blood is drawn, the sample must be transported to thelaboratory as soon as possible for analysis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 527Blood gas analysis\\nA blood gas analyzer from Corning Corporation.

People get sugar fromtheir diet and from their body tissues. Insulin is made bythe pancreas and affects the outer membrane of cells,making it easy for glucose to move from the blood intothe cells. When insulin is active, blood glucose levels fall.Sugar from body tissues is stored in the form of glycogen.When glycogen is active, blood glucose levels rise.\\nAfter a meal, blood glucose levels rise sharply. The\\npancreas responds by releasing enough insulin to takecare of all the newly added sugar found in the body. Theinsulin moves the sugar out of the blood and into thecells. Only then does the blood sugar start to level off and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 528Blood sugar testsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 528'),\n",

A person with diabetes mellitus either does\\nnot make enough insulin, or makes insulin that does notwork properly. The result is blood sugar that remainshigh, a condition called hyperglycemia.\\nDiabetes must be diagnosed as early as possible. If\\nleft untreated, it can damage or cause failure of the eyes,kidneys, nerves, heart, blood vessels, and other bodyorgans. Hypoglycemia , or low blood sugar, may also be\\ndiscovered through blood sugar testing. Hypoglycemia iscaused by various hormone disorders and liver disease,as well as by too much insulin.\\nDescription\\nThere are a variety of ways to measure a person’s\\nblood sugar.\\nWhole blood glucose test\\nWhole blood glucose testing can be performed by a\\nperson in his or her home, and kits are available for thispurpose. The person pricks his or her finger (a fingerstick) with a sterile sharp blade from the kit. A singledrop of blood is placed on a strip in a portable instrumentcalled a glucometer. The glucometer quickly determinesthe blood sugar and shows the results on a small screenin usually a few seconds.\\nFasting plasma glucose test\\nThe fasting plasma glucose test is done on an empty\\nstomach. For the eight hours before the test, the personmust fast (nothing to eat or drink, except water). The per-son’s blood is drawn from a vein by a healthcare worker.The blood sample is collected into a tube containing ananticoagulant. Anticoagulants stop the blood from clot-ting. In the laboratory, the tube of blood spins at highspeed within a machine called a centrifuge. The bloodcells sink to the bottom and the liquid stays on the top.This straw-colored liquid on the top is the plasma. Tomeasure the glucose, a person’s plasma is combined withother substances. From the resulting reaction, the amountof glucose in the plasma is determined.\\nOral glucose tolerance test\\nThe oral glucose tolerance test is done to see how\\nwell the body handles a standard amount of glucose. Thistest measures the amount of glucose in a person’s plasmabefore and two hours after drinking a large premeasuredbeverage containing glucose. The person must eat a con-sistent diet, containing at least 5.25oz (150 g) of carbohy-drates each day, for three days before this test. For eighthours before the test, the person must fast. A healthcareprovider draws the first sample of blood at the end of thefast to determine the glucose level at the start of the test.\\nThe healthcare provider then gives the person a beveragecontaining 2.6 oz (75 g) of glucose. Two hours later, theperson’s blood is drawn again. These blood samples arecentrifuged and processed in the laboratory. A doctor canthen compare the before and after glucose levels to seehow well the body processed the sugar.\\nTwo-hour postprandial blood glucose test\\nThe two-hour postprandial blood glucose test mea-\\nsures the amount of glucose in plasma after a person eatsa specific meal containing a certain amount of sugar.Although the meal follows a predetermined menu, it isdifficult to control many factors associated with this test-ing method.\\nBlood sugar tests can be used in a variety of situa-\\ntions including:\\n• Testing people suspected for diabetes. The American\\nDiabetic Association (ADA) recommends that either afasting plasma glucose test or an oral glucose tolerancetest be used to diagnose diabetes. If the person alreadyhas symptoms of diabetes, a blood glucose test withoutfasting (called a casual plasma glucose test) may bedone. If the test result is abnormal, it must be confirmedwith another test performed on another day. The twotests can be different or they can be the same, but theymust be done on different days. If the second test is alsoabnormal, the person has diabetes. A two-hour post-prandial test is not recommended by the ADA as a testto use for the diagnosis of diabetes. A doctor may orderthis test, and follow it with the oral glucose tolerancetest or the fasting plasma glucose test if the results areabnormal.\\n• Testing pregnant women. Diabetes that occurs during\\npregnancy (gestational diabetes ) is dangerous for\\nboth the mother and the baby. Women who may be atrisk are screened when they are 24-28 weeks pregnant.A woman is considered at risk if she is older than 25years, is not at her normal body weight, has a parent orsibling with diabetes, or if she is in an ethnic group thathas a high rate of diabetes (Hispanics, Native Ameri-cans, Asians, African Americans). The blood sugar testto screen for gestational diabetes is a variation of theoral glucose tolerance test. Fasting is not required. Ifthe result is abnormal, a more complete test is done onanother day.\\n• Testing healthy people. Healthy people without symp-\\ntoms of diabetes should be screened for diabetes whenthey are 45 years old and again every three years. Eitherthe fasting plasma glucose or oral glucose tolerance testis used for screening. People in high risk groups shouldbe tested before the age of 45 and tested more frequently.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 529Blood sugar testsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 529'),\n",

The\\nADA recommends that a person with diabetes keep theamount of glucose in the blood at a normal level as muchas possible. This can be done by the diabetic person test-ing his or her own blood at home one or more times a day.\\nPreparation\\nEach blood sugar test that uses plasma requires a 5\\nmL blood sample. A healthcare worker ties a tight band(tourniquet) on the person’s upper arm, locates a vein inthe inner elbow region, and inserts a needle into thatvein. Vacuum action draws the blood through the needleinto an attached tube. Collection of the sample takes onlya few minutes.\\nWhen fasting is required, the person should have\\nnothing to eat or drink (except water) for eight hoursbefore the test and until the test or series of tests is com-pleted. The person should not smoke before or during thetesting period because this can temporarily increase theamount of glucose in the blood. Other factors that cancause inaccurate results are a change in diet before thetest, illness or surgery two weeks before the test, certaindrugs, and extended bed rest. The doctor may tell a per-son on insulin or taking pills for diabetes to stop themedication until after the test.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the test or series of tests is completed (and\\nwith the approval of his or her doctor), the person shouldeat, drink, and take any medications that were stoppedfor the test.\\nThe patient may feel discomfort when blood is drawn\\nfrom a vein. Bruising may occur at the puncture site orthe person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops will reduce bruising.Warm packs to the puncture site will relieve discomfort.\\nRisks\\nIf the person experiences any weakness, fainting ,\\nsweating, or any other unusual reaction while fasting orduring the test, he or she should immediately tell the per-son giving the test.\\nNormal results\\nNormal results are:\\n• fasting plasma glucose test less than 120 mg/dL\\n• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than 140 mg/dL\\nFor the diabetic person, the ADA recommends an ongo-\\ning blood sugar goal of less than or equal to 120 mg/dL.Abnormal results\\nThese abnormal results indicate diabetes and must\\nbe confirmed with repeat testing:\\n• fasting plasma glucose test less than or equal to 126\\nmg/dL\\n• oral glucose tolerance test, 2 hours less than or equal to\\n200 mg/dL\\n• casual plasma glucose test (nonfasting, with symptoms)\\nless than or equal to 200 mg/dL\\n• gestational oral glucose tolerance test, 1 hour less than\\nor equal to 140 mg/dL\\nBrain damage can occur from glucose levels below\\n40 mg/dL and coma from levels above 470 mg/dL.\\nOther hormone disorders can cause both hyper-\\nglycemia and hypoglycemia.

If the person needs a blood transfu-\\nsion, another test called crossmatching is done after the\\nblood is typed to find blood from a donor that the per-son’s body will accept.\\nPurpose\\nBlood typing and crossmatching are most common-\\nly done to make certain that a person who needs a trans-fusion will receive blood that matches (is compatiblewith) his own. People must receive blood of the sameblood type, otherwise, a serious, even fatal, transfusionreaction can occur.\\nParents who are expecting a baby have their blood\\ntyped to diagnose and prevent hemolytic disease of thenewborn (HDN), a type of anemia also known as ery-\\nthroblastosis fetalis . Babies who have a blood type dif-\\nferent from their mothers are at risk for developing thisdisease. The disease is serious with certain blood typedifferences, but is milder with others.\\nA child inherits factors or genes from each parent\\nthat determine his blood type. This fact makes blood typ-ing useful in paternity testing. To determine whether ornot the alleged father could be the true father, the bloodtypes of the child, mother, and alleged father are com-pared.\\nLegal investigations may require typing of blood or\\nother body fluids, such as semen or saliva, to identifypersons involved in crimes or other legal matters.\\nDescription\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are performed\\nin a blood bank laboratory by technologists trained inblood bank and transfusion services. The tests are doneon blood, after it has separated into cells and serum(serum is the yellow liquid left after the blood clots.)Costs for both tests are covered by insurance when thetests are determined to be medically necessary.\\nBlood bank laboratories are usually located in facili-\\nties, such as those operated by the American Red Cross,that collect, process, and supply blood that is donated, aswell as in facilities, such as most hospitals, that prepareblood for transfusion. These laboratories are regulated bythe United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and are often inspected and accredited by a professionalassociation such as the American Association of BloodBanks (AABB).\\nBlood typing and crossmatching tests are based on\\nthe reaction between antigens and antibodies. An antigencan be anything that causes the body to launch an attack,known as an immune response, against it. The attackbegins when the body builds a special protein, called anantibody, that is uniquely designed to attack and makeineffective (neutralize) the specific antigen that causedthe attack. A person’s body normally doesn’t make anti-bodies against its own antigens, only against antigensthat are foreign to it.\\nA person’s body contains many antigens. The anti-\\ngens found on the surface of red blood cells are impor-tant because they determine a person’s blood type. Whenred blood cells having a certain blood type antigen aremixed with serum containing antibodies against that anti-gen, the antibodies attack and stick to the antigen. In atest tube, this reaction is observed as the formation ofclumps of cells (clumping).\\nWhen blood is typed, a person’s cells and serum are\\nmixed in a test tube with commercially-prepared serumand cells. Clumping tells which antigens or antibodiesare present and reveals the person’s blood type. Whenblood is crossmatched, patient serum is mixed with cellsfrom donated blood that might be used for transfusion.Clumping or lack of clumping in the test tube tellswhether or not the blood is compatible.\\nAlthough there are over 600 known red blood cell\\nantigens, organized into 22 blood group systems, routineblood typing and crossmatching is usually concernedwith only two systems: the ABO and Rh blood groupsystems.\\nBlood typing\\nABO BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. In 1901, Karl Land-\\nsteiner, an Austrian pathologist, randomly combined theserum and red blood cells of his colleagues. From thereactions he observed in test tubes, he discovered theABO blood group system. This discovery earned him the1930 Nobel Prize in Medicine.\\nA person’s ABO blood type—A, B, AB, or O—is\\nbased on the presence or absence of the A and B antigenson his red blood cells. The A blood type has only the Aantigen and the B blood type has only the B antigen. TheAB blood type has both A and B antigens, and the Oblood type has neither A nor B antigen.\\nBy the time a person is six months old, he naturally\\nwill have developed antibodies against the antigens hisred blood cells lack. That is, a person with A blood typewill have anti-B antibodies, and a person with B blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 531Blood typing and crossmatchingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 531'),\n",

A person with AB blood\\ntype will have neither antibody, but a person with Oblood type will have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies.Although the distribution of each of the four ABO bloodtypes varies between racial groups, O is the most com-mon and AB is the least common.\\nABO typing is the first test done on blood when it is\\ntested for transfusion. A person must receive ABO-matched blood. ABO incompatibilities are the majorcause of fatal transfusion reactions. ABO antigens arealso found on most body organs, so ABO compatibility isalso important for organ transplants.\\nAn ABO incompatibility between a pregnant woman\\nand her baby is a minor cause of HDN and usually causesno problem for the baby. The structure of ABO antibod-ies makes it unlikely they will cross the placenta to attackthe baby’s red blood cells.\\nPaternity testing compares the ABO blood types of\\nthe child, mother, and alleged father. The alleged fathercan’t be the true father if the child’s blood type requires agene that neither he nor the mother have. For example, achild with blood type B whose mother has blood type O,requires a father with either AB or B blood type; a man\\nwith blood type O cannot be the true father.\\nIn some people, ABO antigens can be found in body\\nfluids other than blood, such as saliva and semen. ABOtyping of these fluids provides clues in legal investigations.\\nRH BLOOD GROUP SYSTEM. The Rh, or Rhesus,\\nsystem was first detected in 1940 by Landsteiner andWiener when they injected blood from rhesus monkeysinto guinea pigs and rabbits. More than 50 antigens havesince been discovered belonging to this system, makingit the most complex red blood cell antigen system.\\nIn routine blood typing and crossmatching tests,\\nonly one of these 50 antigens, the D antigen, also knownas the Rh factor or Rh\\no[D], is tested for. If the D antigen\\nis present, that person is Rh-positive; if the D antigen isabsent, that person is Rh-negative.\\nOther important antigens in the Rh system are C, c,\\nE, and e. These antigens are not usually tested for in rou-tine blood typing tests.

This incompatibility can happen when anRh-negative woman and an Rh-positive man produce anRh-positive baby. Cells from the baby can cross the pla-centa and enter the mother’s bloodstream, causing themother to make anti-D antibodies. Unlike ABO antibod-ies, the structure of anti-D antibodies makes it likely thatthey will cross the placenta and enter the baby’s blood-stream. There, they can destroy the baby’s red bloodcells, causing severe or fatal anemia.\\nThe first step in preventing HDN is to find out the Rh\\ntypes of the expectant parents.

This procedure is\\nsimilar to blood typing. Finally, the Rh-negative mother isgiven an injection of Rh Immunoglobulin (RhIg) at 28weeks of gestation and again after delivery, if the baby isRh positive. The RhIg attaches to any Rh-positive cellsfrom the baby in the mother’s bloodstream, preventingthem from triggering anti-D antibody production in themother. An Rh-negative woman should also receive RhIgfollowing a miscarriage , abortion, or ectopic pregnancy .\\nOTHER BLOOD GROUP SYSTEMS. Several other\\nblood group systems may be involved in HDN and trans-fusion reactions, although they are much less frequentthan ABO and Rh. They are the Duffy, Kell, Kidd, MNS,and P systems. Tests for antigens from these systems arenot included in routine blood typing, but they are com-monly used in paternity testing.\\nLike Rh antibodies, antibodies in these systems do\\nnot develop naturally, but as an immune response aftertransfusion or during pregnancy.

In eithercase, the crossmatch is continued, even though the trans-fusion has begun.\\nPreparation\\nTo collect the 10 mL blood needed for these tests, a\\nhealthcare worker ties a tourniquet above the patient’selbow, locates a vein in the inner elbow region, andinserts a needle into that vein. Vacuum action draws theblood through the needle into an attached tube. Collec-tion of the sample takes only a few minutes.\\nBlood typing and crossmatching must be done three\\ndays or less before a transfusion. A person doesn’t need tochange diet, medications, or activities before these tests.He should tell his healthcare provider if, during the lastthree months, he has received a blood transfusion or aplasma substitute, or has had a radiology procedure usingintravenous contrast media. These can give false clump-ing reactions in both typing and crossmatching tests.\\nAftercare\\nThe possible side effects of any blood collection are\\ndiscomfort or bruising at the site where the needle punc-tured the skin, as well as dizziness or fainting . Bruising\\nis reduced if pressure is applied with a finger to the punc-ture site until the bleeding stops. Discomfort is treatedwith warm packs to the puncture site.Risks\\nThere are no risks from the blood collection or test\\nprocedures. Blood transfusions always have the risk of anunexpected transfusion reaction. A nurse watches a patientfor signs of a reaction during the entire transfusion.\\nNormal results\\nThere is no normal blood type. The desired result of a\\ncrossmatch is that compatible donor blood is found. Com-patibility testing procedures are designed to provide thesafest blood product possible for the recipient, but a com-patible crossmatch is no guarantee that an unexpectedadverse reaction will not appear during the transfusion.\\nAbnormal results\\nExcept in an emergency, a person cannot receive a\\ntransfusion without a compatible crossmatch result.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Association of Blood Banks.

Urea then circulates in theblood in the form of urea nitrogen. In healthy people,most urea nitrogen is filtered out by the kidneys andleaves the body in the urine. If the patient’s kidneys arenot functioning properly or if the body is using largeamounts of protein, the BUN level will rise. If the patienthas severe liver disease, the BUN will drop.\\nPurpose\\nThe BUN level may be checked in order to assess or\\nmonitor:\\n• the presence or progression of kidney or liver disease.\\n• blockage of urine flow.\\n• mental confusion. Patients with kidney failure are\\nsometimes disoriented and confused.\\n• abnormal loss of water from the body ( dehydration ).\\n• recovery from severe burns . The body uses larger than\\nnormal amounts of protein following serious burns.\\nDescription\\nThe BUN test is performed on a sample of the\\npatient’s blood, withdrawn from a vein into a vacuumtube. The procedure, which is called a venipuncture,takes about five minutes.\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should check to make sure that the\\npatient is not taking any medications that can affect BUNresults. These drugs include the antibiotics chloram-\\nphenicol, streptomycin, amphotericin B, methicillin,gentamicin, tobramycin, and kanamycin, as well asdiuretics and corticosteroids .\\nThe patient should be advised not to eat large\\namounts of meat the day before the test.\\nAftercare\\nAftercare consists of routine care of the area around\\nthe venipuncture.\\nRisks\\nThe primary risk is the possibility of a bruise or\\nswelling in the area of the venipuncture. The patient canapply moist warm compresses.KEY TERMS\\nUrea —A compound containing nitrogen that\\noccurs in the urine and other body fluids as aresult of protein metabolism.\\nNormal results\\nNormal BUN levels are 5-18 mg/dL for children; 7-\\n18 mg/dL for adults; and 8-20 mg/dL in the elderly.\\nAbnormal results\\nBUN levels can be too low as well as too high.\\nAbnormally low BUN\\nLow levels of BUN may indicate overhydration ,\\nmalnutrition ,celiac disease [a disease characterized by\\nthe inability ot tolerate foods containing wheat protein(gluten)], liver damage or disease, or use of corticos-teroids. Low BUN may also occur in early pregnancy .\\nAbnormally high BUN\\nHigh levels of BUN may indicate kidney disease or\\nfailure; blockage of the urinary tract by a kidney stone ortumor; a heart attack or congestive heart failure ; dehy-\\ndration; fever ; shock ; or bleeding in the digestive tract.\\nHigh BUN levels can sometimes occur during late preg-nancy or result from eating large amounts of protein-richfoods.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\\npermission.)Boils\\nDefinition\\nBoils and carbuncles are bacterial infections of hair\\nfollicles and surrounding skin that form pustules (smallblister-like swellings containing pus) around the follicle.Boils are sometimes called furuncles. A carbuncle isformed when several furuncles merge to form a singledeep abscess with several heads or drainage points.\\nDescription\\nBoils and carbuncles are firm reddish swellings about\\n0.2-0.4 in (5-10 mm) across that are slightly raised abovethe skin surface. They are sore to the touch. A boil usuallyhas a visible central core of pus; a carbuncle is larger andhas several visible heads. Boils occur most commonly onthe face, back of the neck, buttocks, upper legs and groinarea, armpits, and upper torso. Carbuncles are less commonthan single boils; they are most likely to form at the back ofthe neck. Males are more likely to develop carbuncles.\\nBoils and carbuncles are common problems in the\\ngeneral population, particularly among adolescents andadults. People who are more likely to develop these skininfections include those with:\\n• diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin• alcoholism or drug abuse• poor personal hygiene• crowded living arrangements• jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub-\\nstances, especially petroleum products\\n• allergies or immune system disorders, including HIV\\ninfection.\\n• family members with recurrent skin infections\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBoils and carbuncles are caused by Staphylococcus\\naureus , a bacterium that causes an infection in an oil\\ngland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human skinis usually resistant to bacterial infection, S. aureus can\\nenter through a break in the skin surface—includingbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or druginjections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasycreams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are morevulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can bespread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close humancontact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.\\nAs the infection develops, an area of inflamed tissue\\ngradually forms a pus-filled swelling or pimple that ispainful to touch. As the boil matures, it forms a yellowishhead or point. It may either continue to swell until thepoint bursts open and allows the pus to drain, or it maybe gradually reabsorbed into the skin. It takes betweenone and two weeks for a boil to heal completely after itcomes to a head and discharges pus. The bacteria thatcause the boil can spread into other areas of the skin oreven into the bloodstream if the skin around the boil isinjured by squeezing. If the infection spreads, the patientwill usually develop chills and fever , swollen lymph\\nnodes ( lymphadenitis ), and red lines in the skin running\\noutward from the boil.\\nFurunculosis is a word that is sometimes used to\\nrefer to recurrent boils. Many patients have repeatedepisodes of furunculosis that are difficult to treat becausetheir nasal passages carry colonies of S. aureus . These\\nbacterial colonies make it easy for the patient’s skin to bereinfected. They are most likely to develop in patientswith diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune systemdisorders.\\nCarbuncles are formed when the bacteria infect sev-\\neral hair follicles that are close together. Carbunculosis isa word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop-ment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until theymerge with each other to form a single large area ofinfected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients withcarbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen-erally unwell.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of boils and carbuncles is usually\\nmade by the patient’s primary care doctor on the basis ofvisual examination of the skin. In some cases involvingrecurrent boils on the face, the doctor may need to con-sider acne as a possible diagnosis, but for the most part\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 536BoilsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 536'),\n",

The doctorcan make a culture from pus taken from the boil or car-buncle to confirm the diagnosis of a staphylococcalinfection. He or she can also culture the patient’s nasaldischarge to test for the presence of a S. aureus colony.\\nTreatment\\nPatient and family education\\nPatient education is an important part of the treatment\\nof boils and carbuncles. Patients need to be warned againstpicking at or squeezing boils because of the danger ofspreading the infection into other parts of the skin orbloodstream. It is especially important to avoid squeezingboils around the mouth or nose because infections in theseareas can be carried to the brain. Patients should also beadvised about keeping the skin clean, washing their handscarefully before and after touching the boil or carbuncle,avoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and keep-ing their towels and washcloths separate from those ofother family members. Some doctors may recommend anantiseptic soap or gel for washing the infected areas.\\nIf the patient has had several episodes of furunculo-\\nsis, the doctor may examine family members or closecontacts to see if they are carriers of S. aureus . In many\\ncases they also need treatment for boils or carbuncles.Skin infections and reinfections involving small groupsor clusters of people are being reported more frequentlyin the United States.\\nMedications\\nBoils are usually treated with application of antibiot-\\nic creams—usually clindamycin or polymyxin—follow-ing the application of hot compresses. The compresseshelp the infection to come to a head and drain.\\nCarbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated with\\noral antibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or oint-\\nments. The specific medications that are given are usual-ly dicloxacillin (Dynapen) or cephalexin (Keflex). Ery-thromycin may be given to patients who are allergic topenicillin. The usual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10days; however, patients with recurrent furunculosis maybe given oral antibiotics for longer periods. Furunculosisis treated with a combination of dicloxacillin andrifampin (Rifadin).\\nPatients with bacterial colonies in their nasal pas-\\nsages are often given mupirocin (Bactroban) to applydirectly to the lining of the nose.Surgical treatment\\nBoils and carbuncles that are very large, or that are\\nnot draining, may be opened with a sterile needle or sur-gical knife to allow the pus to drain. The doctor will usu-ally give the patient a local anesthetic if a knife is used;surgical treatment of boils is painful and usually leavesnoticeable scars.\\nAlternative treatment\\nNaturopathic therapy\\nNaturopathic practitioners usually recommend\\nchanges in the patient’s diet as well as applying herbalpoultices to the infected area. The addition of zinc sup-plements and vitamin A to the diet is reported to beeffective in treating boils. The application of a paste orpoultice containing goldenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis )\\nroot is recommended by naturopaths on the groundsthat goldenseal helps to kill bacteria and reduceinflammation.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopaths maintain that taking the proper homeo-\\npathic medication in the first stages of a boil or carbunclewill bring about early resolution of the infection and pre-vent pus formation. The most likely choices are Bel-\\nladonna or Hepar sulphuris . If the boil has already\\nformed, Mercurius vivus or Silica may be recommended\\nto bring the pus to a head.\\nWestern herbal therapies\\nA variety of herbal remedies can be applied topi-\\ncally to boils to fight infection.

Osteoporosis happens when thebones lose calcium and other minerals that keep them\\nstrong. Osteoporosis begins after menopause in many\\nwomen, and worsens after age 65, often resulting in seri-ous fractures . These fractures may not only bring dis-\\nability, but may affect longevity. As many as one-fourthof women who fracture their hip after age 50 die withinone year.\\nMost people today will get a bone density scan from\\na machine using a technology called Dual Energy X-rayAbsorptiometry or DEXA for short. This machine takes apicture of the bones in the spine, hip, total body andwrist, and calculates their density. If a DEXA machine isnot available, bone density scans can also be done withdual photon absorptiometry (measuring the spine, hipand total body) and quantitative computed tomography\\nscans (measuring the spine). Bone density scanners that\\nuse DEXA technology to just measure bone density inthe wrist (called pDEXA scans) provide scans at somedrugstores. Yet these tests are not as accurate as thosethat measure density in the total body, spine or hip—where most fractures occur.Purpose\\nA bone density scan measures the strength of an\\nindividual’s bones and determines the risk of fracture. Anobservation of any osteoporosis present can be made.\\nDescription\\nTo take a DEXA bone density scan, the patient lies on\\na bed underneath the scanner, a curving plastic arm thatemits x rays. These low-dose x rays form a fan beam thatrotates around the patient. During the test, the scannermoves to capture images of the patient’s spine, hip or entirebody. A computer then compares the patient’s bonestrength and risk of fracture to that of other people in theUnited States at the same age and to young people at peakbone density. Bones reach peak density at age 30 and thenstart to lose mass. The test takes about 20 minutes to do andis painless. The DEXA bone scan costs about $250. Someinsurance companies and Medicare cover the cost. pDEXAwrist bone scans in drugstores are available for about $30.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient puts on a hospital gown and lies on the\\nbed underneath the scanner. Not all doctors routinelyschedule this test. If the following factors apply to apatient, they may need a bone density scan and can dis-cuss this with their doctor.

They also are used pre-\\nscribed for Paget’s disease, a painful condition that weak-ens and deforms bones, and they are used to control calci-um levels in the blood.\\nBone is living tissue. Like other tissue, bone is con-\\nstantly being broken down and replaced with new materi-al. Normally, there is a balance between the breakdownof old bone and its replacement with new bone. Butwhen something goes wrong with the process, bone dis-orders may result.\\nOsteoporosis is a particular concern for women\\nafter menopause, as well as for older men. In osteo-porosis, the inside of the bones become porous and thin.Over time, this condition weakens the bones and makesthem more likely to break. Osteoporosis is four timesmore common in women than in men. This is becausewomen have less bone mass than men, tend to livelonger and take in less calcium, and need the femalehormone estrogen to keep their bones strong. If menlive long enough, they are also at risk of getting osteo-porosis later in life. Once total bone mass has peaked—around age 35—all adults start to lose it. In women, therate of bone loss speeds up during menopause, when\\nestrogen levels fall. Bone loss may also occur if bothovaries are removed by surgery. Ovaries make estrogen.Hormone replacement therapy is one approach to\\npreventing osteoporosis. However, not all people canuse hormone replacement therapy. Bone disorder drugsare a good alternative for people who already haveosteoporosis or who are at risk of developing it. Riskfactors include lack of regular exercise , early\\nmenopause, being underweight, and a strong familyhistory of osteoporosis.\\nDescription\\nBone disorder drugs are available only with a\\nphysician’s prescription and come in tablet, nasalspray, and injectable forms. Commonly used bone dis-order drugs are alendronate (Fosamax), calcitonin(Miacalcin, Calcimar), and raloxifene (Evista). Ralox-ifene belongs to a group of drugs known as selectiveestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), which act likeestrogen in some parts of the body but not in others.This makes the drugs less likely to cause some of theharmful effects that estrogen may cause. Unlike estro-gen, raloxifene does not increase the risk of breast\\ncancer . In fact, research suggests that raloxifene may\\neven reduce that risk.Recommended dosage\\nAlendronate\\nFOR OSTEOPOROSIS. The usual dose is 10 mg once\\na day. Treatment usually continues over many years.\\nFOR PAGET’S DISEASE. The usual dose is 40 mg once\\na day for six months.\\nThis medicine works only when it is taken with a full\\nglass of water first thing in the morning, at least 30 min-utes before eating or drinking anything or taking anyother medicine. Do not lie down for at least 30 minutesafter taking it because the drug can irritate the esophagus,the tube that delivers food form the mouth to the stomach.\\nCalcitonin\\nNASAL SPRAY. The usual dose is one spray into the\\nnose once a day. Alternate nostrils, spraying the rightnostril one day, the left nostril the next day, and so on.\\nINJECTABLE. The recommended dosage depends on\\nthe condition for which the medicine is prescribed andmay be different for different people. Check with thephysician who prescribed the medicine or the pharmacistwho filled the prescription for the proper dosage.\\nRaloxifene\\nThe usual dose is one 60-mg tablet daily.\\nPrecautions\\nAldendronate\\nPeople with low levels of calcium in their blood\\nshould not take this medicine. It also is not recommendedfor women on hormone replacement therapy or for anyonewith kidney problems. Before using alendronate, anyonewho has digestive or swallowing problems should makesure that his or her physician knows about the condition.\\nCalcitonin\\nCalcitonin nasal spray may cause irritation or small\\nsores in the nose. Check with a physician if this becomesvery uncomfortable or if there is bleeding from the nose.\\nThe injectable form of calcitonin has caused serious\\nallergic reactions in a few people. The nasal spray is notknown to cause such reactions, but the possibility exists.Before starting treatment with calcitonin, the physicianwho prescribes the drug may order an allergy test tomake sure there will not be a problem.\\nRaloxifene\\nA rare, but serious side effect of raloxifene is an\\nincreased risk of blood clots that form in the veins and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 542Bone disorder drugsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 542'),\n",

Other important bone-savingsteps are avoiding smoking and alcohol and getting\\nenough of the kind of exercise that puts weight on thebones (such as walking or lifting weights).\\nPeople who are taking these drugs because they have\\ntoo much calcium in their blood may need to limit the\\namount of calcium in their diets. Too much calcium may pre-vent the medicine from working properly. Discuss the properdiet with the physician who prescribed the drug, and do notmake any diet changes without the physician’s approval.\\nAnyone who has had unusual reactions to bone dis-\\norder drugs in the past should let his or her physicianknow before taking the drugs again. The physician alsoshould be told about any allergies to foods, dyes, preser-\\nvatives, or other substances.\\nWomen who are pregnant or who may become preg-\\nnant and women who are breastfeeding should checkwith their physicians before using this alendronate or cal-citonin.

Bone graft is also used tohelp fusion between vertebrae, correct deformities, orprovide structural support for fractures of the spine. Inaddition to fracture repair , bone graft is used to repair\\ndefects in bone caused by birth defects , traumatic injury,\\nor surgery for bone cancer .Description\\nBone is composed of a matrix, mainly made up of a\\nprotein called collagen. It is strengthened by deposits ofcalcium and phosphate salts, called hydroxyapatite.Within and around this matrix are located the cells of thebones, which are of four types. Osteoblasts produce thebone matrix. Osteocytes are mature osteoblasts and serveto maintain the bone. Osteoclasts break down andremove bone tissue. Bone lining cells cover bone sur-faces. Together, these four types of cells are responsiblefor building the bone matrix, maintaining it, and remod-eling the bone as needed.\\nThere are three ways in which a bone graft can help\\nrepair a defect. The first is called osteogenesis, the for-mation of new bone by the cells contained within thegraft. The second is osteoinduction, a chemical processin which molecules contained within the graft (bonemorphogenetic proteins) convert the patient’s cells intocells that are capable of forming bone. The third is osteo-conduction, a physical effect by which the matrix of thegraft forms a scaffold on which cells in the recipient areable to form new bone.\\nNew bone for grafting can be obtained from other\\nbones in the patient’s own body (e.g., hip bones or ribs),called autograft, or from bone taken from other peoplethat is frozen and stored in tissue banks, called allograft.A variety of natural and synthetic replacement materialsare also used instead of bone, including collagen (theprotein substance of the white fibers of the skin, bone,and connective tissues); polymers, such as silicone andsome acrylics; hydroxyapatite; calcium sulfate; andceramics. A new material, called resorbable polymericgrafts, is also being studied. These resorbable grafts pro-vide a structure for new bone to grow on; the grafts thenslowly dissolve, leaving only the new bone behind.\\nTo place the graft, the surgeon makes an incision in\\nthe skin over the bone defect and shapes the bone graft orreplacement material to fit into the defect. After the graftis placed into the defect, it is held in place with pins,plates, or screws. The incision is closed with stitches anda splint or cast is used to prevent movement of the boneswhile healing.\\nThe costs associated with a bone graft vary. These\\ncosts include: the surgeon’s fee (variable); anesthesiolo-gist’s fees (averaging $350 to $400 per hour); hospitalcharges (averaging $1,500 to $1,800 per day, more forintensive care or private rooms); medication charges($200 to $400); and additional charges, including anassisting surgeon, treatment of complications, diagnosticprocedures (e.g., blood work or x rays), medical sup-plies, and equipment use. The cost for the graft itself canrange from $250 to $900.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 544Bone graftingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 544'),\n",

The extent of recovery will depend on thesize of the defect and the condition of the bone sur-rounding the graft at the time of surgery. Severe defectsmay take some time to heal and may require furtherattention after the initial graft. In one study of over1,000 patients who received very large allografts aftersurgery for bone cancer, researchers found that approxi-mately 85% of the patients were able to return to workor normal physical activities without using crutches.However, about 25% of these patients required a secondoperation, because the first did not heal properly. Lesssevere bone defects, though, should heal completelywithout serious complications.\\nRisks\\nThe risks for any surgical procedure requiring anes-\\nthesia include reactions to the medications and breathingproblems. The risks for any surgical procedure includebleeding and infection.\\nThe drawbacks of autografts include: the additional\\nsurgical and anesthesia time (typically 30 minutes perprocedure) to obtain, or harvest, the bone for grafting;added costs of the additional surgery; pain and infection\\nthat might occur at the site from which the graft is taken;and the relatively small amount of bone that is availablefor grafting.\\nThe drawbacks of allografts include: variability\\nbetween lots, since the bone is harvested from a varietyof donors; the bone may take longer to incorporate withthe host bone than an autograft would; the graft may beless effective than an autograft; and the possibility oftransferring diseases to the patient. Other complicationsmay result from the immune response mounted by thepatient’s immune system against the grafted bone tissue.With the use anti-rejection agents (drugs to combatrejection of grafted bone tissue) immune rejection is lessof a problem.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nBrown, Edwin H. “New Bones from the Sea: Tropical Coral.”\\nMedical Update 20 (Jan. 1997): 2.KEY TERMS\\nAllograft —Tissue for transplantation that is taken\\nfrom another person.\\nAutograft —Tissue for transplantation that is taken\\nfrom the patient.\\nHydroxyapatite —A calcium phosphate complex\\nthat is the primary mineral component of bone.\\nOsteoblasts —Bone cells that build new bone tissue.\\nOsteoclasts —Bone cells that break down and\\nremove bone tissue.\\nOsteoconduction —Provision of a scaffold for the\\ngrowth of new bone.\\nOsteocytes —Bone cells that maintain bone tissue.\\nOsteogenesis —Growth of new bone.\\nOsteoinduction —Acceleration of new bone for-\\nmation by chemical means.\\nCowley, Geoffrey. “Replacement Parts.” Newsweek 129 (27\\nJan. 1997): 66.\\nDeLacure, Mark D. “Physiology and Healing of Bone Grafts.”\\nOtolaryngologic Clinics of North America 27, no. 5\\n(1994): 859.\\nFarley, Dixie. “New Ways to Heal Broken Bones.” FDA Con-\\nsumer 30 (Apr. 1996): 14.\\nHayes, Ketra Marie, and Nancy L.

This condition is called fracturenonunion, and it occurs more frequently among adultsthan children, in people with severe or complex fractures,and in people who smoke.\\nThe theory behind applying an electric current to\\nfractures to stimulate healing is based on the fact thatthe concave side of the bone becomes negativelycharged and the convex side is positively charged. It isbelieved that artificially encouraging this charging withan electric current will speed healing. In 1996, the Foodand Drug Administration (FDA) also approved theapplication of low intensity ultrasound pulses as a treat-ment for fracture nonunion.\\nUltrasound and electromagnetic stimulation are\\nexpensive and are used only when healing problems existfor a substantial length of time. Each method must beused for at least three to six months to be effective.\\nPrecautions\\nBone growth stimulation cannot be used if the gap\\nbetween the ends of the fracture is too large.\\nDescription\\nElectric stimulation can be applied either from the\\ninside of the body (invasively) or from the outside thebody (noninvasively). Ultrasound is a noninvasive pro-cedure. The type of stimulation selected depends on thedoctor’s preference, the type and location of the fracture,and the patient’s motivation to comply with the treat-ment schedule. Treatment can take anywhere from threeto six months.Invasive stimulators\\nInvasive electric stimulators are either fully or partial-\\nly implantable. The advantage of these devices is that theyapply a direct electric current to the fracture 24 hours aday. The fully implantable stimulator requires little dailyattention from the patient. Patients using a semi-implantedstimulator must regulate their own treatment schedule andhave to care for the external power pack. The disadvantageof implantable and semi-implantable stimulators is thattheir implantation is a surgical procedure.\\nFully implantable direct current stimulators are\\ninstalled in a hospital under general or regional anesthesia.Both the stimulator and the power source are implanted.The surgeon makes an incision and places a spiral shapedcathode inside the bone. A wire leads to the power sourceand a small anode. The power source is a battery pack thatis implanted in the nearby muscle. The body transmitselectrical current to close the circuit. The incision is thenclosed. Once in place, the device provides continuousdirect electric current for bone growth stimulation.\\nPartially implanted stimulators use cathode pins that\\nare implanted at the edge of each bone that is fractured.Wires lead to the surface of the skin where a powersource and the anode are located. Wires complete the cir-cuit. The external portion of the device is held in place bya cast. This source of stimulation also runs continuously.\\nNoninvasive stimulators\\nIn the noninvasive stimulator, external electromag-\\nnetic coils are placed on either side of the fracture andare held in place by a strap or cuff. Locating the coilscorrectly is important, and their location relative to thefracture is usually confirmed by x rays.\\nThe coils produce a pulsating electromagnetic field.\\nIt is up to the patient to maintain the prescribed treatmentschedule. Effective treatment requires stimulation any-where from three to ten hours each day in periods of noless than one hour.\\nUltrasound stimulation is the most recent treatment\\nfor stimulating bone growth. A device that generates lowintensity pulses of sound is applied to the skin over thefracture. The advantage of this technique is that it is non-invasive and the period of application of the sound pulsescan be as short as 20-30 minutes each day. The results ofthis treatment have been studied less than the effect ofelectromagnetic stimulation.\\nPreparation\\nBone growth stimulation is done only when healing\\nhas failed to occur for many months. Before it is started,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 546Bone growth stimulationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 546'),\n",

If the device is to be\\nimplanted, standard preoperative blood and urine testsare done. The patient may meet with an anesthesiologistto discuss any conditions that might affect the adminis-tration of anesthesia.\\nAftercare\\nIf a noninvasive, pulsating, electromagnetic field\\ndevice is used, the patient must not put any stress or\\nweight on the fracture until it is healed, which is a matterof months in most cases. In all lower limb fractures,regardless of the stimulation method used, the patient cannot bear weight on the limb with the fracture until heal-ing is complete. This limits the patient’s mobility formany months. Patients have the responsibility for regu-larly making sure that the unit works and caring forexternal devices and the casts that hold them in place.\\nRisks\\nNoninvasive devices have few risks associated with\\nthem.

These blood cells are vital for normal bodyfunctions, such as oxygen transport, defense againstinfection and disease, and clotting. Blood cells have alimited lifespan and are constantly being replaced; there-fore, healthy stem cells are vital.\\nIn association with certain diseases, stem cells may\\nproduce too many, too few, or otherwise abnormal bloodcells. Also, medical treatments may destroy stem cells oralter blood cell production. The resultant blood cellabnormalities can be life threatening.\\nBone marrow transplantation involves extracting\\nbone marrow containing normal stem cells from ahealthy donor, and transferring it to a recipient whosebody cannot manufacture proper quantities of normalblood cells. The goal of the transplant is to rebuild therecipient’s blood cells and immune system and hopefullycure the underlying ailment.\\nPurpose\\nA person’s red blood cells, white blood cells, and\\nplatelets may be destroyed or may be abnormal due todisease. Also, certain medical therapies, particularlychemotherapy or radiation treatment, may destroy a\\nperson’s stem cells. The consequence to a person’s healthis severe. Under normal circumstances, red blood cellscarry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbondioxide from the body’s tissues. White blood cells formthe cornerstone of the body’s immune system and defendit against infection. Platelets limit bleeding by enablingthe blood to clot if a blood vessel is damaged.\\nA bone marrow transplant is used to rebuild the\\nbody’s capacity to produce these blood cells and bringtheir numbers to normal levels. Illnesses that may betreated with a bone marrow transplant include both can-cerous and noncancerous diseases.\\nCancerous diseases may or may not specifically\\ninvolve blood cells; but, cancer treatment can destroy the\\nbody’s ability to manufacture new blood cells. Bone mar-row transplantation may be used in conjunction withadditional treatments, such as chemotherapy, for varioustypes of leukemia, Hodgkin’s disease , lymphoma, breast\\nand ovarian cancer , and other cancers. Noncancerous\\ndiseases for which bone marrow transplantation can be atreatment option include aplastic anemia ,sickle cell\\ndisease ,thalassemia , and severe immunodeficiency .\\nPrecautions\\nBone marrow transplants are not for everyone.\\nTransplants are accompanied by a risk of infection, trans-plant rejection by the recipient’s immune system, andother complications. The procedure has a lower successrate the greater the recipient’s age. Complications areexacerbated for people whose health is already seriouslyimpaired as in late-stage cancers. Therefore, a person’sage or state of health may prohibit use of a bone marrowtransplant. The typical cut-off age for a transplant rangesfrom 40 to 55 years; however, a person’s general health isusually the more important factor.\\nEven in the absence of complications, the transplant\\nand associated treatments are hard on the recipient. Bonemarrow transplants are debilitating. A person’s ability towithstand the rigors of the transplant is a key considera-tion in deciding to use this treatment.\\nDescription\\nAutologous and allogeneic transplants\\nTwo important requirements for a bone marrow\\ntransplant are the donor and the recipient. Sometimes,the donor and the recipient may be the same person. Thistype of transplant is called an autologous transplant. It istypically used in cases in which a person’s bone marrowis generally healthy but will be destroyed due to medicaltreatment for diseases such as breast cancer and\\nHodgkin’s disease. Most bone marrow transplants areautologous. If a person’s bone marrow is unsuitable foran autologous transplant, the bone marrow must bederived from another person in an allogeneic transplant.\\nAllogeneic transplants are more complicated\\nbecause of proteins called human lymphocyte antigens\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 550Bone marrow transplantationGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 550'),\n",

If\\nthe donor and the recipient have very dissimilar antigens,the recipient’s immune system regards the donor’s bonemarrow cells as invaders and launches a destructiveattack against them. Such an attack negates any benefitsoffered by the transplant.\\nHLA matching\\nThere are only five major HLA classes or types—\\ndesignated HLA–A,–B, –C,–D, and class III—but muchvariation within the groupings. For example, HLA–Afrom one individual may be similar to, but not the sameas, HLA–A in another individual; such a situation canrender a transplant from one to the other impossible.\\nHLA matching is more likely if the donor and recip-\\nient are related, particularly if they are siblings; however,an unrelated donor may be a potential match. Only inrare cases is matching HLA types between two peoplenot an issue: if the recipient has an identical twin. Identi-cal twins carry the same genes; therefore, the same anti-gens. A bone marrow transplant between identical twinsis called a syngeneic transplant.\\nPeripheral blood stem cell transplants\\nA relatively recent development in stem cell trans-\\nplantation is the use of peripheral blood cells instead ofstem cells from bone marrow. Peripheral blood stem cells(PBSCs) are obtained from circulating blood rather thanfrom bone marrow, but the amount of stem cells found inthe peripheral blood is much smaller than the amount ofstem cells found in the bone marrow. Peripheral bloodstem cells can be used in either autologous or allogeneictransplants. The majority of PBSC transplants are autolo-gous. However, recent clinical studies indicate thatPBSCs are being used more frequently than bone mar-row for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\\nThe advantages of PBSC transplants when compared\\nto bone marrow transplants are: in allogeneic transplanta-tion, haematopoietic and immune recovery are faster withPBSCs which reduces the potential for disease recur-rence, primarily graft-versus-host-disease. In autologoustransplantation, the use of PBSCs can result in fasterblood count recoveries. Also, some medical conditions\\nexist in which the recipient cannot accept bone marrowstem cell transplants, but can accept PBSC transplants.Some possible disadvantages to PBSC transplant versusbone marrow transplantation are: so much more fluid vol-ume is necessary to collect enough PBSCs that, at thetime of infusing the new stem cells into the recipient, thefluid can collect in the lungs or cause temporary kidneyproblems. Also, the time commitment for the donor for aPBSC transplant is considerable. When the PBSCs arebeing collected, several outpatient sessions are needed\\nand each session lasts approximately two–four hours.\\nThe transplant procedure\\nBONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION. The bone mar-\\nrow extraction, or harvest, is the same whether for an autol-ogous or allogeneic transplant. Harvesting is done undergeneral anesthesia (i.e., the donor sleeps through the proce-dure), and discomfort is usually minimal afterwards. Bonemarrow is drawn from the iliac crest (the part of the hipbone to either side of the lower back) with a special needleand a syringe. Several punctures are usually necessary tocollect the needed amount of bone marrow, approximately1–2 quarts (0.9-1.91). (This amount is only a small percent-age of the total bone marrow and is typically replaced with-in four weeks.) The donor remains at the hospital for 24–48hours and can resume normal activities within a few days.\\nIf the bone marrow is meant for an autologous trans-\\nplant, it is stored at –112 to –320°F (–80 to –196°C) untilit is needed. Bone marrow for an allogeneic transplant issometimes treated to remove the donor’s T cells (a typeof white blood cell) or to remove ABO (blood type) anti-gens; otherwise, it is transplanted without modification.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 551Bone marrow transplantation\\nIn autologous bone marrow transplantation, stem cells are\\ncollected from the patient. Once the patient has undergonechemotherapy, the cells are replaced in the blood via an intra-venous catheter.The cells return to the bone marrow andbegin producing healthy new cells.

A radioac-tive substance is injected intravenously, and the image ofits distribution in the skeletal system is analyzed to detectcertain diseases or conditions.\\nPurpose\\nBone scans are most frequently ordered to check\\nwhether a cancer that originated elsewhere has spread to\\nthe bones. Cancers which begin in the breasts, kidneys,lungs, prostate, thyroid, or urinary bladder are most like-ly to spread, or metastasize, to the bones. If metastasesare found, periodic bone scans may be ordered to see iftherapy is effective against a cancer.\\nSome cancers arise in bone. These are called primary\\nbone cancers. When an abnormality is found on an x ray ofa bone, a bone scan may be helpful in deciding if it is a pri-mary bone cancer, or a non-cancerous (benign) condition.Infection in the bone ( osteomyelitis ) can be detected\\nor confirmed by a bone scan, often days or weeks beforean x ray would reveal it. Bone scans are useful in diag-nosing early arthritic changes, and monitoring both theprogression of the disease and the effectiveness of treat-ment. Unexplained pain may be evaluated with a bone\\nscan, because it can demonstrate fractures which are dif-\\nficult to detect on x ray. Bone scans can be used to see ifartificial joints have loosened or become infected. Sus-pected child abuse may be evaluated with a bone scan,\\ndue to its ability to see an overall pattern of repeatedtrauma. Abnormalities caused by altered circulation tothe bone may be diagnosed with a bone scan.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should\\nnot have this test. A patient who is unable to remain stillfor an extended period of time may require sedation for\\na bone scan.\\nDescription\\nThis test is performed in a radiology facility, either\\nin a hospital department or an outpatient x-ray center.The patient usually sits or lies down while a radioactivesubstance is injected through a vein in the arm. For abone scan, the radionuclide used is specifically chosen toaccumulate in the bone. The patient then waits from threeto four hours, for the substance to collect within theskeletal system. During this time, he or she will beinstructed to drink several glasses of water. Patients arefree to get up and move around as they desire during thiswaiting time, and should urinate frequently. Just beforethe scanning begins, the patient should empty his or herbladder again. This ensures that a lot of radioactive mate-rial is not concentrated in the urinary bladder, whichcould obscure part of the pelvic bones.\\nDuring the scan, the patient lies on his or her back\\non a table, but may be repositioned to the stomach or sideduring the study. It is important for the patient not tomove, except when directed to by the technologist.\\nThe radionuclide scanner, sometimes called a\\ngamma camera, or scintillation camera, is positionedagainst the body part to be examined. Either the camera,the table, or both, may change position during the study.For a total body bone scan, the patient is scanned fromhead to foot, over a period of 30-60 minutes.

The camera circles completelyaround the area in question or multiple cameras are usedto create a cross-sectional image. This helps pinpoint thelocation of the abnormality being evaluated.\\nAnother variation is called a three-phase, or three-\\nstage, bone scan. The procedure is the same, except thescanning takes place immediately after the radioactivesubstance is injected, approximately 20 minutes after theinjection, then two to four hours later.\\nPreparation\\nSome specialized blood studies should be drawn\\nbefore this study is begun. Jewelry or metallic objectsneed to be removed. No other special physical prepara-tion is required.\\nThe patient should understand that there is no dan-\\nger of radioactive exposure to themselves or others, asonly small amounts of the radioisotope are used. Thetotal dose of radiation absorbed is minimal, often lessthan the amount received from ordinary x rays. Theradionuclide scanner does not emit any radiation at all,but detects and records it from the patient.\\nAftercare\\nFluids are encouraged after the scan to aid in the\\nexcretion of the radioisotope. It is almost completelyeliminated from the body within 24 hours.\\nNormal results\\nThe normal appearance of the scan will vary accord-\\ning to the patient’s age. In general, a uniform concentra-tion of radionuclide uptake is present in all bones in anormal scan.\\nAbnormal results\\nA high concentration of radionuclide occurs in areas\\nof increased bone activity.

The physicianreads the developed x ray on a wall-mounted light box.\\nDigital x rays are a new type of x ray in which con-\\nventional equipment is used to take the x ray but theimage is produced via computer. In a digital x ray, theimage is created on a reusable plate. After being read bya laser reader, the information is sent in digital form to astorage unit connected to a computer network fromwhich the radiologist reads the x ray. An electronic reportcan then be sent to the patient’s physician.\\nProblems with bones that x rays can detect result\\nfrom injury or from disease caused by a malfunction inthe patient’s bone chemistry. Bone injuries, especiallybroken bones ( fractures ), are common and can be\\naccurately diagnosed by bone x rays. X rays are espe-cially helpful in diagnosing simple and incomplete frac-tures which can’t be detected during a physical exami-\\nnation . X rays can also be used to check for bone posi-\\ntion in a fracture. Some bone diseases can be definitive-ly diagnosed with bone x rays while others requireadditional tests.\\nOsteoporosis , a common bone disease, can be detect-\\ned in bone x rays but other tests are then ordered to deter-mine the extent of the disease. For osteomalacia and rick-ets, a blood test and x rays of the affected bone are usuallydefinitive; in some cases a bone biopsy (microscopic\\nanalysis of a small ammount of tissue) is also done. In arare bone disease called Paget’s disease, x rays may beused in conjunction with bone, blood, and urine tests tomake a diagnosis. In another rare bone disease, fibrousdysplasia, bone x rays or a bone biopsy (microscopicanalysis of a small amount of tissue) are used to confirmthe diagnosis. Bone x rays are definitive in diagnosingosteogenesis imperfecta . For osteomyelitis , bone x rays\\nare used in conjunction with a blood test, bone scan, orneedle biopsy to make the diagnosis. For arthritis, x raysof the bone are occasionally used in conjunction withblood tests. In bone tumors, bone x rays are helpful butthey may not be definitive.Bone x rays are performed by a technician or radiol-\\nogist, and interpreted by a radiologist. They are taken ina physician’s office, radiology unit, outpatient clinic, ordiagnostic clinic. Bone x rays generally take less than 10minutes. There is no pain or discomfort associated with\\nthe test, but some people find it difficult to remain still.The results are often available in minutes.\\nDuring the test, the patient lies on a table. The tech-\\nnician taking the x ray will check the patient’s position-ing and place the x-ray machine over the part of the bodybeing examined. After asking the patient to remainmotionless, he or she steps out of the area and presses abutton to take the picture.\\nPreparation\\nThe patient is asked to remove clothing, jewelry, and\\nany other metal objects from the area being x rayed. Ifappropriate, a lead shield will be placed over other bodyparts to minimize exposure to radiation.\\nAftercare\\nThe patient can immediately resume normal activities.\\nRisks\\nThe human body contains some natural radiation\\nand is also exposed to radiation in the environment.There is a slight risk from exposure to radiation duringbone x rays, however, the amount of radiation is smalland the risk of harm is very low. If reproductive organsare exposed to radiation, genetic alterations may occur.Excessive or repeated doses of radiation can causechanges in other types of body tissue. No radiationremains in the body after the x ray.\\nNormal results\\nNormal bones show no fractures, dislocations, or\\nother abnormalities.\\nAbnormal results\\nResults that indicate the presence of bone injury or\\ndisease differ in appearance according to the nature of theinjury/disease. For example, fractures show up as clearbreaks in the bones, while osteoporotic bone has the sameshape as a normal bone on an x ray but is less dense.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nA Manual of Laboratory and Diagnostic Tests. 5th ed.

Therelief is likely due to the decrease in localized musclespasms, as no direct effect of Botox on the sensorynerves has been established.\\nPrecautions\\nBotulinum toxin is produced from the bacterium that\\ncauses food poisoning in humans. High doses of the\\ntoxin can be fatal; however, doses administered therapeu-tically are so small that harmful effects are uncommon.\\nDescription\\nThe number of potential applications for botulinum\\ntoxin extends to every muscle group. The first therapeu-tic use of Botox was in the treatment of strabismus (eyes\\nare unable to direct towards the same object) and sincethen it has been used to treat a variety of involuntarymuscle contractions or disorders. Its cosmetic use is theresult of treatment for facial spasms where smoothing offacial lines was reported by patients. In general, 90% ofinjections for facial spasms are resolved satisfactorily.\\nToxin type A has a duration of effect that lasts\\napproximately three months and is the therapeutic agentof choice for most conditions.\\nPreparation\\nThe dosage of Botox must be monitored and adjust-\\ned, with multiple injections showing a lower incidence ofcomplications versus administration by one larger dose.\\nRisks\\nIn over 30 years of therapeutic use in humans, botu-\\nlinum toxin has proven to be remarkably safe.

Occasionally,patients report flu-like symptoms but they are usuallyself-limited.\\nA certain percentage of patients may also experience\\nresistance to the toxin. The presence of circulating anti-bodies to the toxin is presumed to be the primary reasonfor resistance to Botox injections. Patients who have lit-tle reaction to Botox ‘A’ may benefit from injectionsusing one of the other six serotypes.

Exposure to the botulinum toxin occurs mostlyfrom eating contaminated food, or in infants, from cer-tain clostridia growing in the intestine. Botulinum toxinblocks motor nerves’ ability to release acetylcholine, theneurotransmitter that relays nerve signals to muscles, andflaccid paralysis occurs. As botulism progresses, the\\nmuscles that control the airway and breathing fail.\\nDescription\\nBotulism occurs rarely, but it incites concern\\nbecause of its high fatality rate. Clinical descriptions ofbotulism possibly reach as far back in history as ancientRome and Greece. However, the relationship betweencontaminated food and botulism wasn’t defined until thelate 1700s. In 1793 the German physician, JustiniusKerner, deduced that a substance in spoiled sausages,which he called wurstgift (German for sausage poison),\\ncaused botulism. The toxin’s origin and identityremained elusive until Emile von Ermengem, a Belgianprofessor, isolated Clostridium botulinum in 1895 and\\nidentified it as the poison source.\\nThree types of botulism have been identified: food-\\nborne, wound, and infant botulism. The main differencebetween types hinges on the route of exposure to thetoxin. In the United States, there are approximately 110cases of botulism reported annually. Food-borne botu-lism accounts for 25% of all botulism cases and can betraced to eating contaminated home-preserved food.Infant botulism accounts for 72% of all cases, but therecovery rate is good (about 98%) with proper treatment.\\nThough domestic food poisoning is a problem\\nworld-wide, there has been a growing concern regardingthe use of botulism toxin in biological warfare and terror-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 559BotulismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 559'),\n",

The Iraqi government admitted in 1995 that it\\nhad loaded 11,200 liters of botulinum toxin into SCUDmissiles during the Gulf War. Luckily, these special mis-siles were never used. As of 1999, there were 17 coun-tries known to be developing biological weapons, includ-ing the culture of botulism toxins.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nToxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botu-\\nlinum is the main culprit in botulism. Other members of\\nthe clostridium genus can produce botulinum toxin,\\nnamely C. argentinense ,C. butyricum , and C. baratii ,b u t\\nthey are minor sources. To grow, these bacteria require alow-acid, oxygen-free environment that is warm (40-120°F or 4.4-48.8°C) and moist. Lacking these condi-tions, the bacteria transform themselves into spores that,like plant seeds, can remain dormant for years. Clostridiaand their spores exist all over the world, especially in soiland aquatic sediments. They do not threaten human oranimal health until the spores encounter an environmentthat favors growth. The spores then germinate, and thegrowing bacteria produce the deadly botulism toxin.\\nScientists have discovered that clostridia can produce\\nat least seven types of botulism toxin, identified as A, B,C, D, E, F, and G. Humans are usually affected by A, B, E,and very rarely F. Domesticated animals such as dogs, cat-tle, and mink are affected by botulism C toxin, which alsoaffects birds and has caused massive die-offs in domesticbird flocks and wild waterfowl. Botulism D toxin cancause illness in cattle, and horses succumb to botulism A,B, and C toxin. There have been no confirmed human oranimal botulism cases linked to the G toxin.\\nIn humans, botulinum toxin latches onto specific\\nproteins in nerve endings and irreversibly destroysthem. These proteins control the release of acetyl-choline, a neurotransmitter that stimulates musclecells. With acetylcholine release blocked, nerves arenot able to stimulate muscles. Ironically, botulinumtoxin has found a beneficial niche in the world of med-icine due to this action. Certain medical disorders arecharacterized by involuntary and uncontrollable mus-cle contractions. Medical researchers have discoveredthat injecting a strictly controlled dose of botulinumtoxin into affected muscles inhibits excessive musclecontractions. The muscle is partially paralyzed andnormal movement is retained.\\nSymptoms\\nThe three types of human botulism include the fol-\\nlowing symptoms:• Food-borne. Food that has been improperly preserved or\\nstored can harbor botulinum toxin-producing clostridia.Botulism symptoms typically appear within 18-36 hoursof eating contaminated food, with extremes of fourhours to eight days. Initial symptoms include blurred ordouble vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking.Possible gastrointestinal problems include constipation ,\\nnausea, and vomiting. As botulism progresses, the vic-tim experiences weakness or paralysis, starting with thehead muscles and progressing down the body. Breathingbecomes increasingly difficult. Without medical care,respiratory failure and death are very likely.\\n• Infant. Infant botulism was first described in 1976.\\nUnlike adults, infants younger than 12 months are vul-nerable to C. botulinum colonizing the intestine. Infants\\ningest spores in honey or simply by swallowing spore-containing dust. The spores germinate in the largeintestine and, as the bacteria grow, they produce botu-linum toxin that is absorbed into the infant’s body. Thefirst symptoms include constipation, lethargy, and poorfeeding. As infant botulism progresses, sucking andswallowing (thus eating) become difficult. A nursingmother will often notice breast engorgement as the firstsign of her infant’s illness. The baby suffers overallweakness and cannot control head movements. Becauseof the flaccid paralysis of the muscles, the baby appears“floppy.” Breathing is impaired, and death from respira-tory failure is a very real danger.\\n• Wound. Confirmed cases of wound botulism have been\\nlinked to trauma such as severe crush injuries to theextremities, surgery, and illegal drug use. Wound botu-lism occurs when clostridia colonize an infected woundand produce botulinum toxin. The symptoms usuallyappear four to 18 days after an injury occurs and aresimilar to food-borne botulism, although gastrointesti-nal symptoms may be absent.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of botulism can be tricky because symp-\\ntoms mimic those presented by other diseases. Botulismmay be confused with Guillain-Barre syndrome, myas-\\nthenia gravis , drug reactions, stroke , or nervous system\\ninfection, intoxications (e.g. carbon monoxide oratropine), or shellfish poisoning . Sepsis is the most com-\\nmon initial diagnosis for infant botulism. Failure to\\nthrive may also be suspected. Some reports have linked\\ninfant botulism to 5-15% of sudden infant death syn-\\ndrome (SIDS, crib death) cases. Laboratory tests are\\nused for definitive diagnosis, but if botulism seems like-ly, treatment starts immediately.\\nWhile waiting for laboratory results, doctors ask\\nabout recently consumed food and work to dismiss other\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 560BotulismGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 560'),\n",

The antitoxin(effective against toxin types A, B, and E) inactivatesonly the botulinum toxin that is unattached to nerve end-ings. Early injection of antitoxin (usually within 24 hoursof onset of symptoms) can preserve nerve endings, pre-vent progression of the disease, and reduce mortality.\\nInfants, however, cannot receive the antitoxin used\\nfor adults.

It takes weeks tomonths to recover from botulism, and severe cases cantake years before a total recovery is attained. Recoverydepends on the nerve endings building new proteins toreplace those destroyed by botulinum toxin.\\nPrevention\\nVaccines against botulism do not exist to prevent\\ninfant botulism or other forms of the disease.

If any part of a cannedfood container is rusty or bulging, the food should notbe eaten.

Colonoscopy is an effective\\ntreatment procedure for polyps (a growing mass of tis-sue). This procedure enables visualization of the entirelarge bowel. During a colonoscopy, polyps can be cauter-ized (applying an electric current which incinerates thepolyp). The procedure can be both diagnostic and thera-peutic.

Wright, RN\\nBowel surgery with ostomy seeColostomy\\nBowel training\\nDefinition\\nBowel training helps to reestablish normal bowel\\nmovements in persons who suffer from constipation ,\\ndiarrhea , incontinence, or irregularity. Healthy bowel\\nactivity is considered one or two movements of moderatesize every day.\\nPurpose\\nMany people for many reasons have irregular bowel\\nfunction. In some cases, the irregularity lasts beyond thecondition that caused it. The bowels by themselves developbad habits that can be retrained with suitable exercises andeducation. Normal bowel habits not only improve the qual-ity of life, they help prevent several common diseases—forexample, diverticulitis and fecal impaction. Gall stones,appendicitis ,colon cancer , hiatal hernia , diabetes, and\\nheart disease have also been related to the quality of bowelmovements and the foods that affect them.\\n• One of the most common causes of constipation is the\\nlaxative habit. Repeated artificial stimulation of thebowels destroys their natural emptying reflex, so thatthey will no longer move without artificial stimulants.The laxative habit begins innocently enough with thecorrect belief that bowels should move every day, how-ever, laxatives will cause the evacuation of several days\\nworth of stool in a single movement. Impatient for stoolto reaccumulate for the necessary few days, the patienttakes another laxative, and the cycle begins.\\n• The other major cause of constipation is a diet with\\ninsufficient bulk or roughage. The bowel works moresmoothly the more contents it has. Western diets of\\nhighly refined foods have eliminated most of the residuefrom food. The result is that most food is absorbed, leav-ing little to pass through and be excreted as feces.\\n• Constipation occurs acutely with impaction—the pres-\\nence in the rectum of a mass of feces too large to pass.Fecal impaction is usually the result of poor bowelhabits, a diet with too little liquid and roughage, andinadequate physical activity.\\n• Diarrhea, whether acute or chronic, can disrupt the\\nbowel’s normal rhythm and lead to irregularity.\\n• Several diseases of the nervous system affect bowel\\nreflexes.\\nDescription\\nBowel training reestablishes the bowel’s normal\\nreflexes by repeating a routine until it becomes a habit.Naturally the patient must be able and willing to cooper-ate. Some patients are so convinced they need daily laxa-tives that they are afraid to do without them. It takes timefor a changed diet to effect the bowels and for the bowel toregain its normal rhythm. Trust and patience are necessary.\\nAfter gaining the patient’s cooperation, the next step\\nis to optimize the diet. Healthy bowel movements requireingestion of a large amount of liquids and bulk foods.The patient should drink two to three quarts of liquidsevery day, with liberal inclusion of prune juice and per-haps coffee for their natural laxative effect. Bulk comesfrom unrefined foods. Oat bran, wheat bran, brown rice,green vegetables, apples, and pears are a few examples ofhigh residue foods. Many patients will benefit fromadding bulk preparations of psyllium. Constipating foodslike bananas and cheese should be avoided until a naturalrhythm is well established.\\nTo assure that stools are soft enough to pass easily, it\\nis a good idea to add a pure stool softener like DOSS(dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), two to four per day asneeded. DOSS also helps prevent impaction.\\nThere is usually a time of day when bowel move-\\nments are more likely to occur. In anticipation of thistime, the patient should participate in activities that stim-ulate a normal bowel movement. Walking, eating unre-fined foods, and drinking prune juice or coffee, encour-age natural evacuation. It is acceptable to use lubricantssuch as glycerine suppositories or oil enemas at this\\ntime. For severe constipation, water enemas may beneeded to initiate a movement.\\nIt is also important for the patient to recognize the\\nurge to defecate and to respond right away to that urge.The longer stool sits in the rectum, the more water therectum will absorb from it, making it harder and moredifficult to pass.\\nNormal results\\nWith patience and diligence, normal bowel habits\\nand the health that comes with them will return in mostpatients.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 565Bowel trainingGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 565'),\n",

Under certain circumstances, however, bacteriacan invade the brain and cause a localized infectioncalled an abscess. Brain abscess is relatively rare,accounting for 1 in 10,000 hospital admissions. Singleabscess occurs in 75% of cases, and the remainder ofcases involve multiple abscesses. If not treated, brainabscess is almost always fatal.KEY TERMS\\nDefecate —To pass feces (stool) out of the rectum\\nthrough the anus.\\nDiverticulitis —Infection of outpouchings in the\\nlarge bowel.\\nFecal impaction —Obstruction of the rectum by a\\nlarge mass of feces (stool).\\nHiatal hernia —Part of the stomach displaced\\nthrough the diaphragm into the chest.Causes and symptoms\\nOne-half of all brain abscesses are caused by the\\nspread of bacteria from a nearby infection. Sources ofbacteria include:\\n• middle ear infections ( otitis media ) or infections in the\\nbony spaces in front of the middle ear ( mastoiditis )\\n• sinus infections\\n• an abscessed tooth.\\nOther sources of bacteria include:• lung infections\\n• abdominal infection\\n• infection of the heart’s lining ( endocarditis )\\n• penetrating head wounds\\n• neurosurgery\\nAcquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) or\\nthe presence of another immune deficiency greatlyincreases the risk of brain abscess. Approximately 25%of cases have no detectable cause of infection.\\nBrain abscess can be caused by a variety of organ-\\nisms, many of them related to ear and sinus infections.Many times brain abscess cases are caused by two ormore bacteria. In 30–60% of cases, the bacteria combina-tion includes streptococci, microorganisms that can livewithout oxygen (anaerobes), and enterobacteria. A smallnumber of cases are caused by yeast, fungi, and single-cell organisms (protozoa).\\nThe symptoms of brain abscess often develop slow-\\nly, usually within a period of about two weeks. The mostcommon symptoms are:\\n• headache• neurologic symptoms related to the specific part of the\\nbrain that is infected\\n• altered mental status\\n• seizures\\nFever and stiff neck occur in less than one-third of\\ncases. Additional symptoms may include vomiting, eyetremor ( nystagmus ), poor balance, and uncoordinated\\nmovements.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of brain abscess is performed by using a\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT) or a magnetic reso-\\nnance imaging (MRI) scan to determine the site of\\ninfection. Tissue removal (biopsy) is usually performedas well. A biopsy is performed to determine the type ofbacterium involved. Biopsies can also be used to rule out\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 566Brain abscessGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 566'),\n",

These tests include blood cultures, x raysof the chest, and a physical exam of the ears, sinuses, andteeth. A test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nis usually also performed.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment for brain abscess begins with intravenous\\nantibiotics , chosen to match the infecting bacterium if\\nknown, or to cover a wide spectrum of possibilities if not.Treatment usually continues for six to eight weeks.\\nAspiration surgery is almost always done to drain the\\nabscess. In this procedure, a needle is guided to the infect-ed site by CT scan, and fluid is removed (aspirated) fromthe abscess. Aspiration may be repeated several timesuntil the bacteria are completely killed or removed. Surgi-cal removal of infected or dead tissue may be needed insome cases. For patients with many sites of infection,aspiration or surgical removal is not done because of theincreased difficulty and risk of the procedure. For thesepatients, antibiotic therapy alone is used. Steroid treat-ment is controversial, but may be indicated in some cases.\\nPrognosis\\nEven with prompt treatment, brain abscess is fatal in\\nabout 20% of cases. About half of those who survivehave some residual neurological problems, includingseizures in many patients.\\nThere are several reasons why patients with brain\\nabscess can have a poor prognosis. The illness may notbe diagnosed correctly or an accurate diagnosis may takeadditional time. The patient may receive an antibioticthat does not match the infecting organism. Sometimesthe infection may not be limited to a definite area in thebrain, making diagnosis and treatment difficult. Thesmall number of cases caused by fungal infection maytake additional time to diagnose. A patient may also havea poor prognosis because there is more than one abscess,the location of the abscess may be deep within the brain,or the infection may have moved into many locationswithin the brain. Severe complications can result frombrain abscess, including comma and brain rupture. In 80-100% of cases involving brain rupture, the patient dies.\\nPrevention\\nBrain abscess may be preventable by prompt and\\naggressive treatment of the infections which give rise toit, especially sinus and ear infections.KEY TERMS\\nBiopsy —The removal of a tissue sample for exami-\\nnation.\\nAspiration —Removal of fluid from a closed space\\nthrough a needle.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.

It is highly unusu-al for malignant brain tumors to spread beyond the cen-tral nervous system (CNS).\\nPrimary brain tumors\\nPrimary brain tumors originate in the brain. They\\nrepresent about 1% of all cancers and 2.5% of all cancerdeaths.\\nMetastatic or secondary brain tumors\\nApproximately 25% of all cancer patients develop\\nsecondary or metastatic brain tumors when cancer cellsspread from another part of the body to the brain.

These metastatic brain\\ntumors can develop on any part of the brain or spinalcord.• cancer within the nasal passages and/or throat that fol-\\nlow the nerve pathways into the skull, and metastasizeto the brain.\\nWho gets brain tumors\\nBrain tumors can develop at any age, but are most\\ncommon in children between the ages of 3-12, and inadults aged 55-65. Primary brain cancer is the secondmost common cause of cancer death between birth andthe age of 34, and the fourth most common cause of can-cer death in men aged 35-54. Primary tumors of the brainand central nervous system are often associated with HIVinfection. Men and caucasians have a higher risk of devel-oping brain tumors. Other risk factors being studiedinclude children with a history of previous radiation treat-ment to the head for cancer; parents with certain cancers(nervous system, salivary gland, colon); having an olderfather; having well-educated parents; occupational expo-sure to vinyl chloride, lead, and pesticides; history ofepilepsy; history of certain genetic conditions (tuberoussclerosis, neurofibromatosis , von Hippel Lindau, famil-\\nial polyposis , Osler-Weber-Rendu, Li-Fraumeni).\\nNaming and grading brain tumors\\nThe name of a brain tumor describes where it origi-\\nnates, how it grows, and what kind of cells it contains. Atumor in an adult is also graded or staged according to:\\n• how malignant it is\\n• how rapidly it is growing and how likely it is to invade\\nother tissues\\n• how closely its cells resemble normal cells. (The more\\nabnormal a tumor cell looks, the faster it is likely togrow)\\nLow-grade brain tumors usually have well-defined\\nborders. Some low-grade brain tumors form or areenclosed (encapsulated) in cysts. Low-grade braintumors grow slowly, if at all. They may spread through-out the brain, but rarely metastasize to other parts of thebody.\\nMid-grade and high-grade tumors grow more rapid-\\nly than low-grade tumors. Described as “truly malig-nant,” these tumors usually infiltrate healthy tissue. Thegrowth pattern makes it difficult to remove the entiretumor, and these tumors recur more often than low-gradetumors.\\nA single brain tumor can contain several different\\ntypes of cells. The tumor’s grade is determined by thehighest-grade (most malignant) cell detected under amicroscope, even if most of the cells in the tumor are lessmalignant. An infiltrating tumor is a tumor of any gradethat grows into surrounding tissue.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 569Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 569'),\n",

Gliomas arise from glial tis-sue, which supports and nourishes cells that send mes-sages from the brain to other parts of the body. Thesetumors may be either malignant or benign. Astrocy-tomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas are three ofthe most common gliomas.\\nASTROCYTOMAS. Named for the star-like shape of\\ntheir cells, astrocytomas can develop on any part of thebrain or spinal cord. Non-infiltrating astrocytomas growslowly, and rarely spread to nearby tissue. Mild-to-mod-erately anaplastic astrocytomas with well-differentiatedborders do not grow as slowly as non-infiltrating astrocy-tomas, and they do spread to surrounding tissues.\\nAnaplastic astrocytomas, which are also called\\nGrade III astrocytomas, look more abnormal and growmore rapidly than non-infiltrating or mild-to-moderatelyanaplastic tumors.\\nGrade IV astrocytomas are also called glioblastoma\\nmultiforme (GBM) tumors. Accounting for 30% of allprimary brain tumors, GBMs are the most common braintumors in middle-aged adults. GBMs are the most malig-nant of all brain tumors. Because they contain a greatermixture of cells than any other brain tumor, they are themost difficult to treat.\\nEPENDYMOMAS. Also called ependymal tumors,\\nependymomas account for 9% of all gliomas, and 5% ofall intracranial tumors. These tumors, which are mostcommon in children and adolescents, begin in the verythin membranes that help form cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)and line the brain cavities (ventricles) that contain it.\\nEpendymomas are usually benign, have well-differ-\\nentiated borders, resemble normal cells, and grow veryslowly. The cells of anaplastic (malignant) ependymo-mas look abnormal and grow more rapidly than the cellsof benign tumors.\\nMIXED GLIOMAS. These heterogeneous tumors con-\\ntain elements of astrocytomas and ependymomas and/oroligodendrogliomas. These are rare tumors that usuallyoccur in middle-aged adults, grow slowly, and do notusually spread beyond the part of the brain where theyoriginate. Mixed gliomas behave like tumors composedof the highest-grade cells they contain.\\nNon-glial brain tumors\\nThe most common brain tumors that do not develop\\nfrom glial cells are medulloblastomas, meningiomas, andSchwannomas.MEDULLOBLASTOMAS. Scientists once thought\\nmedulloblastomas (MDLs) developed from glial cells.These fast-growing, malignant tumors are now believedto originate in developing cells not normally present inthe body after birth. They are sometimes called primitiveneurodectal tumors (PNET).\\nMDL tumors are most common in children and are\\nmore common in boys than in girls. Only 30% of MDLtumors occur in adults. MDL tumors usually originatein the cerebellum (the part of the brain that controlscoordination and some muscle activity), and are oftencarried to other parts of the brain by cerebrospinal fluid.MDL tumors rarely metastasize beyond the brain andspinal cord.\\nMENINGIOMAS. Meningiomas, which represent\\nmore than 20% of all primary brain tumors, originate inthe membranes that enclose the brain and spinal cord(meninges). These tumors are usually benign and mostoften occur in women aged 30-50 years old. Menin-giomas grow so slowly that the brain can sometimesbecome accustomed to their presence. Meningiomascompress, rather than invade, brain tissue and may growto be quite large before any symptoms appear.\\nSCHWANNOMAS. Schwannomas originate in the\\nSchwann cells. These cells produce myelin, material thatprotects the acoustic nerve, which controls hearing.These benign tumors are twice as common in women asin men, and are most often diagnosed in patients betweenthe ages 30-60.\\nSchwannomas grow very slowly, and many people\\nadapt to the slight hearing loss and balance problems\\nthat are the tumors’ earliest symptoms. A pear-shapedSchwannoma can cause sudden or gradual loss of hear-ing in an ear. As the tumor progresses, it can press on thenerves that control movement and feeling in the face, andcause headaches and facial numbness or tingling. Thepatient may have trouble walking, swallowing, or con-trolling eye movements, and the sense of taste can beaffected. A Schwannoma that grows large enough topress on the brainstem can be deadly.\\nCHILDHOOD BRAIN TUMORS. Brain tumors that\\noccur in children are described as supratentorial (in theupper part of the brain) or infratentorial (in the lowestpart of the brain). Astrocytomas and ependymomas arecommon supratentorial tumors. Infratentorial tumorsinclude medulloblastomas, astrocytomas, and ependy-momas.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is unknown, but\\npeople who work with rubber and certain chemicals havea greater-than-average risk of developing them.

Because sur-geons cannot be sure that every bit of an infiltrating ormetastasizing tumor has been removed, radiation andchemotherapy are used to eradicate cells that may haveescaped the scalpel.\\nIf a tumor cannot be completely removed, removing\\na portion of it (debulking) can alleviate the patient’ssymptoms, enhance the sense of well-being, and increasethe effectiveness of other treatments.\\nRadiation therapy\\nExternal radiotherapy, generally delivered on an out-\\npatient basis, directs radiation to the tumor and the areaaround it. Implant radiation therapy involves placing tiny\\npieces of radioactive material in the brain. Left in placepermanently, or for a short time, these radioactive pelletsrelease measured doses of radiation each day. This tech-nique is called brachytherapy. Patients are usually hospi-talized during the several days the pellets are most active.\\nStereoactic radiosurgery involves fitting the patient\\nwith a frame to stabilize the head, using imaging tech-niques to determine the exact location of tumor cells, andusing a sophisticated instrument to administer radiationprecisely to that point. Instruments used for delivery ofradiation include the gamma knife, adapted linear accel-erator (LINAC), and cyclotron.\\nA variety of drugs may also be given during radia-\\ntion therapy, to protect brain cells from the effects ofradiation (radioprotective drugs), to increase the sensitiv-ity of tumor cells to radiation (radiosensitizers), or toboost radiation’s effects (radioenhancers).\\nChemotherapy\\nOne or more cancer-killing drugs may be taken by\\nmouth or injected into a blood vessel, muscle, or the cere-brospinal fluid. Chemotherapy may be used with radia-tion and surgery as part of a patient’s initial treatment, orused alone to treat tumors that recur in the same place orin another part of the body. The usual chemotherapy regi-men for a brain tumor is a combination approach, mostcommonly using procarbazine, CCNU, and vincristine.\\nNew methods of delivering chemotherapy are being\\nused as well. These include:\\n• interstitial chemotherapy is performed at the time of\\nsurgery. A chemotherapy-soaked wafer is placed in thecavity left after tumor removal.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 572Brain tumorGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 572'),\n",

This can be accomplished surgi-cally, or by withdrawing tissue through a needle.\\nPurpose\\nA biopsy is recommended when a significant\\nabnormality is found, either on physical examination\\nand/or by an imaging test. Examples of abnormality caninclude a breast lump felt during physical self examina-tion or tissue changes noticed from a mammogram test.Before a biopsy is performed, it is important to makesure that the threat of cancer cannot be disproved or\\nruled out by a simpler, less invasive examination. Alump may be obviously harmless when examined byultrasound. If this is not decisive, the presence of canceror a variety of benign breast conditions can be deter-mined using a biopsy.\\nPrecautions\\nThe type of biopsy recommended should be consid-\\nered. This will depend on whether the area can be felt,how well it can be seen on mammogram or ultrasound,and how suspicious it feels or appears. Specializedequipment is needed for different types of biopsy andavailability may vary. Generally, needle biopsy is lessinvasive than surgical biopsy. It is appropriate for most,but not all situations. However, some surgeons feel it isfar less accurate.\\nDescription\\nSurgical biopsy\\nIf an abnormality is not felt during a self examina-\\ntion, there are signs that indicate the need for medicalattention. These include:\\n• severe breast pain\\n• changes in the size of a breast or the nipple\\n• changes in the shape of both breast or nipple• pitting, dumpling or redness of the breast skin\\n• nipple redness, irritation, or inversion\\n• changes in the pattern of veins visible on the surface of\\nthe breast\\n• some types of nipple discharge\\nIf the abnormality is not felt, a needle localization\\nmust be done before the actual surgery. After local anes-thetic is administered, a fine wire is placed in the area ofconcern. Either x ray or ultrasound guidance is used. Thepatient is awake and usually sitting up.\\nThere are two types of breast biopsy considered\\nhere, excisional and incisional. An excisional biopsy is asurgical procedure, where the entire area of concern andsome surrounding tissue is removed. It is usually done asan outpatient procedure, in a hospital or free standingsurgery center. The patient may be awake, and is some-times given medication to make her drowsy. The area tobe operated on is numbed with local anesthetic. Infre-quently, general anesthesia is used.\\nAn excisional biopsy itself usually takes under one\\nhour. The total amount of time spent at the facilitydepends on the type of anesthesia used, whether a needlelocalization was done, and the extent of the surgery.\\nIf a mass is very large, an incisional biopsy may be\\nperformed. In this case only a portion of the area isremoved and sent for analysis. The procedure is the sameas an excisional biopsy in other respects.\\nNeedle biopsy\\nA needle biopsy removes part of the suspicious area\\nfor examination. There are two types, aspiration biopsy(using a fine needle), and large core needle biopsy. Eitherof these may be called a percutaneous needle biopsy. Per-cutaneous refers to a procedure done through the skin.\\nA fine needle aspiration biopsy uses a very thin nee-\\ndle to withdraw fluid and cells that can be studied. It canbe done in a doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital. Localanesthetic may be used, but is sometimes withheld, as itmay be more painful than the biopsy needle. The area toplace the needle may be located by touch. No specializedequipment is needed. However, using ultrasound guid-ance enables the physician to feel and see the lesion atthe same time. The actual withdrawing of fluid and cellscan be visualized as it occurs. This helps ensure that thespecimen is taken from the right place.\\nA large core needle biopsy uses a larger diameter\\nneedle to remove small pieces of tissue, about the size ofa grain of rice. It can be done in a clinic or hospital thathas the appropriate facilities. Local anesthetic is routine-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 575Breast biopsyGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:08 PM  Page 575'),\n",

Ultrasound or x ray is used for guidance of a\\nlarge core needle biopsy.\\nIf the suspicious area is seen best with x ray, a stereo-\\ntactic device is used. This means that x rays are taken fromseveral angles. This information is fed into a computer,which analyzes the data and guides the needle to the correctplace. The patient may be sitting up, or she may be lying onher stomach, with her breast positioned through an openingin the table. The breast is held firmly, but comfortablybetween a plastic paddle and a metal plate, similar to thoseused for mammograms (a set of x rays taken of the frontand side of the breast). X rays may be taken before, during,and after the tissue is drawn into the needle, to confirm thatthe correct spot is biopsied. This procedure may also bereferred to as a stereotactic core biopsy, or a mammotomy.\\nUltrasound is used to guide needle placement for\\nsome lesions. The patient lies on her back or side. After thearea is numbed, sterile gel is applied. The physician placesa transducer, an instrument about the size of an electricshaver, over the skin. This produces an image from thereflection of sound waves. A special needle, usually in aspring loaded device, is used to obtain the tissue. The pro-cedure is observed on a monitor as it is happening.\\nPreparation\\nA surgical breast biopsy may require the patient to\\nhave nothing to eat or drink for a period of time beforethe operation. This will typically be from midnight the\\nnight before, if general anesthesia is planned. No foodrestrictions are necessary for needle biopsy. It is advis-able to eat lightly before the procedure. This is especiallyimportant if the patient will be lying on her stomach for astereotactic biopsy.\\nAftercare\\nAfter a surgical biopsy, the incision will be closed\\nwith stitches, and covered with a bandage. The bandagecan usually be removed in one or two days. Stitches aretaken out approximately one week afterward. Dependingon the extent of the operation, normal activities can beresumed in approximately one to three days. Vigorousexercise may be limited for one to three weeks.\\nThe skin opening for a needle biopsy is minimal. It\\nmay be closed with thin, clear tape, called a steri strip, orcovered with a bandaid and a small gauze bandage. Thepatient can return to her usual routine immediately afterthe biopsy. Strenuous activity or heavy lifting is not rec-ommended for 24 hours. Any bandages can be removedone or two days after the biopsy.\\nRisks\\nInfection is always a possibility when the skin is\\nbroken, although this rarely occurs.

This is a collection of blood at thebiopsy site. It is usually absorbed naturally by the body.If it is very large and uncomfortable, it may need to bedrained. A surgical breast biopsy may produce a visiblescar on the breast. Sometimes this may make futuremammograms harder to interpret accurately.\\nA false negative pathology report is another risk.\\nThis means that no cancer was found when a cancer waspresent. The incidence of this varies with the biopsytechnique. In general, fine needle aspiration biopsieshave the highest rate of false negative results, but theremay be variation in results between facilities.\\nNormal results\\nA normal pathology report indicates no malignancy\\nis present. The tissue sample may be further classified asa benign breast condition, such as tumor of the breast(fibroadenoma ) or connective tissue that resembles\\nfiber (fibrosis). Studies have demonstrated that approxi-mately 80% of all breast biopsies result in a benignpathology report.\\nAbnormal results\\nAn abnormal pathology report indicates a cancer is\\npresent. If a fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed,the pathologist has viewed individual cells under amicroscope to see if they appear cancerous. Large coreneedle biopsy and surgical biopsy will be able to givemore information. This includes the type of cancer,whether it has invaded surrounding tissue, and how likelyit is to spread quickly. There are some conditions whichare not malignant but indicate high risk for future devel-opment of breast cancer . If these are identified, more\\nfrequent monitoring of the area may be recommended.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBaron-Faust, Rita. Breast Cancer: What Every Woman Should\\nKnow.

The malignant cells origi-nate in the lining of the milk glands or ducts of the breast(ductal epithelium), defining this malignancy as a cancer.Cancer cells are characterized by uncontrolled divisionleading to abnormal growth and the ability of these cellsto invade normal tissue locally or to spread throughoutthe body, in a process called metastasis.\\nDescription\\nBreast cancer arises in the milk-producing glands of\\nthe breast tissue. Groups of glands in normal breast tis-sue are called lobules. The products of these glands aresecreted into a ductal system that leads to the nipple.Depending on where in the glandular or ductal unit of thebreast the cancer arises, it will develop certain character-istics that are used to sub-classify breast cancer intotypes. The pathologist will denote the subtype at the timeof evaluation with the microscope. Ductal carcinomabegins in the ducts, lobular carcinoma has a patterninvolving the lobules or glands.

The stage before invasive cancer is called in situ ,\\nmeaning that the early malignancy has not yet becomecapable of invasion. Thus, ductal carcinoma in situ isconsidered a minimal breast cancer.\\nHow breast cancer spreads\\nThe primary tumor begins in the breast itself but once\\nit becomes invasive, it may progress beyond the breast tothe regional lymph nodes or travel (metastasize) to otherorgan systems in the body and become systemic in nature.Lymph is the clear, protein-rich fluid that bathes the cellsthroughout the body. Lymph will work its way back to thebloodstream via small channels known as lymphatics.Along the way, the lymph is filtered through cellular sta-tions known as nodes, thus they are called lymph nodes.Nearly all organs in the body have a primary lymph nodegroup filtering the tissue fluid, or lymph, that comes fromthat organ. In the breast, the primary lymph nodes areunder the armpit, or axilla. Classically, the primary tumorbegins in the breast and the first place to which it is likelyto spread is the regional lymph nodes. Cancer, as itinvades in its place of origin, may also work its way intoblood vessels. If cancer gets into the blood vessels, theblood vessels provide yet another route for the cancer tospread to other organs of the body.\\nBreast cancer follows this classic progression though\\nit often becomes systemic or widespread early in thecourse of the disease. By the time one can feel a lump inthe breast it is often 0.4 inches, or one centimeter, in sizeand contains roughly a million cells. It is estimated that atumor of this size may take one to five years to develop.During that time, the cancer may metastasize, or spreadby lymphatics or blood to areas elsewhere in the body.\\nWhen primary breast cancer spreads, it may first go\\nto the regional lymph nodes under the armpit, the axil-lary nodes. If this occurs, regional metastasis exists. If itproceeds elsewhere either by lymphatic or blood-bornespread, the patient develops systemic metastasis that mayinvolve a number of other organs in the body. Favoritesites of systemic involvement for breast cancer are thelung, bones, liver, and the skin and soft tissue. As it turnsout, the presence of, and the actual number of, regionallymph nodes containing cancer remains the single bestindicator of whether or not the cancer has become widelymetastatic. Because tests to discover metastasis in otherorgans may not be sensitive enough to reveal minutedeposits, the evaluation of the axilla for regional metasta-sis becomes very important in making treatment deci-sions for this disease.\\nIf breast cancer spreads to other major organs of the\\nbody, its presence will compromise the function of thoseorgans. Death is the result of extreme compromise of\\nvital organ function.\\nDemographics\\nEvery woman is at risk for breast cancer. If she lives\\nto be 85, there is a one out of nine chance that she willdevelop the condition sometime during her life. As awoman ages, her risk of developing breast cancer risesdramatically regardless of her family history. The breastcancer risk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of19,608; by age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, less than 5% ofcases are discovered before age 35 and the majority of allbreast cancers are found in women over age 50.\\nIn 1999, there were 180,000 new cases of breast can-\\ncer diagnosed. About 45,000 women die of breast cancereach year, accounting for 16% of deaths caused by cancerin women. For the first time ever, mortality rates decreasedan average of 1.7% per year from 1995 through 1999, areflection of earlier diagnosis and improving therapies.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThere are a number of risk factors for the develop-\\nment of breast cancer, including:\\n• family history of breast cancer in mother or sister• early onset of menstruation and late menopause\\n• reproductive history: women who had no children or\\nhave children after age 30 and women who have neverbreastfed have increased risk\\n• history of abnormal breast biopsies\\nThough these are recognized risk factors, it is impor-\\ntant to note that more than 70% of women who get breastcancer have no known risk factors. Having several riskfactors may boost a woman’s chances of developingbreast cancer, but the interplay of predisposing factors iscomplex. In addition to those accepted factors listedabove, some studies suggest that high-fat diets ,obesity ,\\nor the use of alcohol may contribute to the risk profile.Another factor that may contribute to a woman’s riskprofile is hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\\nHRT provides significant relief of menopausal\\nsymptoms, prevention of osteoporosis , and possibly pro-\\ntection from cardiovascular disease and stroke . Howev-\\ner, studies show that there is a small increased risk ofdeveloping breast cancer with HRT use. Thus, the use ofhormone replacement therapy should be based on per-sonal risk factors.\\nOf all the risk factors listed above, family history is\\nthe most important.

Another gene (BRCA-2) also appears to confer inherited vulnerability to early-onset breast cancers. However, breast cancer due toheredity is only a small proportion of breast cancer cases;only 5%–10% of all breast cancer cases will be womenwho inherited a susceptibility through their genes. Nev-ertheless, when the family history is strong for develop-ment of breast cancer, a woman’s risk is increased.\\nNot all lumps detected in the breast are cancerous.\\nFibrocystic changes in the breast are extremely common.Also known as fibrocystic condition of the breast , fibro-\\ncystic changes are a leading cause of non-cancerous lumpsin the breast. Fibrocystic changes also cause symptoms ofpain , swelling, or discharge and may become evident to\\nthe patient or physician as a lump that is either solid orfilled with fluid. Complete diagnostic evaluation of anysignificant breast abnormality is mandatory becausethough women commonly develop fibrocystic changes,breast cancer is common also, and the signs and symptomsof fibrocystic changes overlap with those of breast cancer.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer is accomplished by the\\nbiopsy of any suspicious lump or mammographic abnor-mality that has been identified. (A biopsy is the removal oftissue for examination by a pathologist. A mammogram isa low-dose, 2-view, x-ray examination of the breast.) Thepatient may be prompted to visit her doctor upon finding alump in a breast, or she may have noticed skin dimpling,nipple retraction, or discharge from the nipple. Or, thepatient may not have noticed anything abnormal, and alump is detected by the mammogram.\\nWhen a patient has no signs or symptoms\\nScreening involves the evaluation of women who\\nhave no symptoms or signs of a breast problem, so whenthe screening mammogram leads to the evaluation, thepatient has no symptoms and may not have any abnor-mality on examination of the breast. Mammography has\\nbeen very helpful in detecting breast cancer that one can-not identify on physical examination . However,\\n10%–13% of breast cancer does not show up on mam-mography, and a similar number of patients with breastcancer have an abnormal mammogram and a normalphysical examination. These figures emphasize the needfor examination as part of the screening process.\\nScreening\\nIt is recommended that women get into the habit of\\ndoing monthly breast self examinations to detect anylump at an early stage. If an uncertainty or a lump is\\nfound, evaluation by an experienced physician and mam-mography is recommended. The American Cancer Soci-ety (ACS) has made recommendations for the use ofmammography on a screening basis. There has been con-troversy about the timing and appropriate frequency ofmammography when used as a screening tool, but theACS recommendations are as follows: Women shouldget annual mammograms after age 40. Those with a sig-nificant family history (one or more first-degree relativeswho have been treated for breast cancer), should startannual mammograms 10 years younger than theyoungest relative was when she was diagnosed, but notearlier than 35.\\nBecause of the greater awareness of breast cancer in\\nrecent years, screening evaluations by examinations andmammography are performed much more frequently thanin the past. The result is that the number of breast cancersdiagnosed increased, but the disease is being diagnosed atan earlier stage than previously.

Skin dimpling, nip-ple retraction, or discharge from the nipple are less fre-quent initial findings prompting biopsy. Though bloodynipple discharge is distressing, it is most often caused bybenign disease. Skin dimpling or nipple retraction in thepresence of an underlying breast mass on examination isa more advanced finding. Actual skin involvement, withedema or ulceration of the skin, are late findings.\\nA very common presenting sign is the presence of a\\nbreast lump. If the lump is suspicious and the patient hasnot had a mammogram by this point, a study should bedone on both breasts prior to anything else so that theoriginal characteristics of the lesion can be studied. Theopposite breast should also be evaluated mammographi-cally to determine if other problems exist that were unde-tected by physical examination.\\nWhether an abnormal screening mammogram or one\\nof the signs mentioned above followed by a mammogramprompted suspicion, the diagnosis is established byobtaining tissue by biopsy of the area. There are differenttypes of biopsy, each utilized with its own indicationdepending on the presentation of the patient. If signs ofwidespread metastasis are already present, biopsy of themetastasis itself may establish diagnosis.\\nBiopsy\\nDepending on the situation, different types of biopsy\\nmay be performed. The types include incisional and exci-sional biopsies. In an incisional biopsy, the physiciantakes a sample of tissue, and in excisional biopsy, themass is removed. Fine needle aspiration biopsy and coreneedle biopsy are kinds of incisional biopsies.\\nFINE NEEDLE ASPIRATION BIOPSY. In a fine needle\\naspiration biopsy, a fine-gauge needle may be passed intothe lesion and cells from the area suctioned into the nee-dle can be quickly prepared for microscopic evaluation(cytology). (The patient experiencing nipple dischargecan have a sample taken of the discharge for cytologicalevaluation, also.) Fine needle aspiration is a simple pro-cedure that can be done under local anesthesia, and willtell if the lesion is a fluid-filled cyst or whether it is solid.The sample obtained will yield much diagnostic informa-tion. Fine needle aspiration biopsy is an excellent tech-nique when the lump is palpable and the physician caneasily hit the target with the needle. If the lesion is a sim-ple cyst, the fluid will be evacuated and the mass willdisappear. If it is solid, the diagnosis may be obtained.\\nCare must be taken, however, because if the mass is solidand the specimen is non-malignant, a complete removalof the lesion may be appropriate to be sure.\\nCORE NEEDLE BIOPSY. Core needle biopsies are also\\nobtained simply under local anesthesia. The larger pieceof tissue obtained with its preserved architecture may behelpful in confirming the diagnosis short of open surgicalremoval. An open surgical incisional biopsy is rarelyneeded for diagnosis because of the needle techniques. Ifthere remains question as to diagnosis, a complete opensurgical biopsy may be required.\\nEXCISIONAL BIOPSY. When performed, the excision-\\nal, (complete removal) biopsy is a minimal outpatientprocedure often done under local anesthesia.\\nNON-PALPABLE LESIONS. As screening increases,\\nnon-palpable lesions demonstrated only by mammogra-phy are becoming more common. The use of x rays andcomputers to guide the needle for biopsy or to placemarkers for the surgeon performing the excisional biopsyare commonly employed. Some benign lesions can befully removed by multiple directed core biopsies. Thesetechniques are very appealing because they are minimal-ly invasive; however, the physician needs to be careful toobtain a good sample.\\nOther tests\\nIf a lesion is not palpable and has simple cystic char-\\nacteristics on mammography, ultrasound may be utilizedboth to determine that it is a cyst and to guide its evacua-tion. Ultrasound may also be used in some cases to guidefine needle or core biopsies of the breast.\\nComputed tomography (CT scan, CAT scans), and\\nmagnetic resonance imaging , (MRI), have only a very\\noccasional use in the evaluation of breast lesions.\\nTreatment\\nStaging\\nOnce diagnosis is established, before treatment is\\nrendered, more tests are done to determine if the cancerhas spread beyond the breast. These tests include a chest\\nx ray and blood count with liver function tests . Along\\nwith the liver function measured by the blood sample, thelevel of alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme from bone, isalso determined. A radionuclear bone scan may beordered. This test looks at the places in the body to whichbreast cancer usually metastasizes. A CT scan may alsobe ordered. The physician will do a careful examinationof the axilla to assess likelihood of regional metastasisbut unfortunately this exam is not very accurate.

This helps define treatment proto-col and prognosis. After surgical treatment, the final, orpathologic, stage is defined as the true axillary lymphnode status is known. Detailed staging criteria are avail-able from the American Joint Commission on CancerManual and are generalized here:\\n• Stage 1—The cancer is no larger than 2 cm (0.8 in) and\\nno cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage 2—The cancer is between 2 cm and 5 cm, and the\\ncancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage 3A—Tumor is larger than 5 cm (2 in) or is small-\\ner than 5 cm, but has spread to the lymph nodes, whichhave grown into each other.\\n• Stage 3B—Cancer has spread to tissues near the breast,\\n(local invasion), or to lymph nodes inside the chestwall, along the breastbone.\\n• Stage 4—Cancer has spread to skin and lymph nodes\\nbeyond the axilla or to other organs of the body.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all uti-\\nlized in the treatment of breast cancer. Depending on thestage, they will be used in different combinations orsequences to effect an appropriate strategy for the typeand stage of the disease being treated.\\nSURGERY. Historically, surgical removal of the\\nentire breast and axillary contents along with the musclesdown to the chest wall was performed as the lone thera-py, (radical mastectomy ). In the last twenty-five years,\\nas it has been appreciated that breast cancer is often sys-temic early in its course, the role of surgery is still prima-ry but of less and less magnitude.\\nToday, surgical treatment is best thought of as a\\ncombination of removal of the primary tumor and stag-ing of the axillary lymph nodes. If the whole breast isremoved along with the entire axillary contents, but themuscles of the chest wall are not, the modified radicalmastectomy has been performed.\\nIf the tumor is less than 1.5 in (4 cm) in size and\\nlocated so that it can be removed without destroying areasonable cosmetic appearance of the residual breast,just the primary tumor and a rim of normal tissue will beremoved. The axillary nodes will still be removed forstaging purposes, usually through a separate incision.Because of the risk of recurrence in the remaining breasttissue, radiation is used to lessen the chance of localrecurrence. This type of primary therapy is known as\\nlumpectomy , (or segmental mastectomy), and axillary\\ndissection.\\nCurrently the necessary extent of the axillary dissec-\\ntion is being questioned. Sentinel lymph node biopsy ,a\\ntechnique for identifying which nodes in the axilla drainthe tumor, has been developed to provide selective sam-pling and further lessen the degree of surgical trauma thepatient experiences.\\nWhen patients are selected appropriately based on\\nthe preoperative clinical stage, all of these surgicalapproaches have been shown to produce similar results.In planning primary surgical therapy, it is imperative thatthe operation is tailored to fit the clinical circumstance ofthe patient.\\nThe pathologic stage is determined after surgical\\ntreatment absolutely defines the local parameters. Inaddition to stage, there are other tests that are very neces-sary to aid in decisions regarding treatment. Handling ofthe surgical specimen is thus very important.

Microscopic evaluation may also include the\\nassessment of lymphatic or blood vessel invasion asthese predict a worse outcome. The DNA of the tumorcells is quantitatively analyzed to help decide the biolog-ic aggressiveness of the tumor. These parameters will beutilized collectively along with the axillary lymph nodestatus to define the anticipated aggressiveness of the can-cer. This assessment, along with the age and general con-dition of the patient, will be considered when planningthe adjuvant therapies. Adjuvant therapies are treatmentsutilized after the primary treatment to help ensure that nomicroscopic disease exists and to help prolong patients’survival time.\\nRADIATION. Like surgical therapy, radiation thera-\\npyis a local modality—it treats the tissue exposed to it\\nand not the rest of the body. Radiation is usually givenpost-operatively after surgical wounds have healed. The\\npathologic stage of the primary tumor is now known andthis aids in treatment planning. The extent of the localsurgery also influences the planning. Radiation may notbe needed at all after modified radical mastectomy forstage I disease, but is almost always utilized when breast-preserving surgery is performed. If the tumor was exten-sive or if multiple nodes were involved, the field of tissueexposed will vary accordingly. Radiation is utilized as anadjunct to surgical therapy and is considered an importantmodality in gaining local control of the tumor. The use ofradiation therapy does not affect decisions for adjuvanttreatment. In the past, radiation was used as an alternativeto surgery on occasion. However, now that breast-pre-serving surgical protocols have been developed, primaryradiation treatment of the tumor is no longer performed.Radiation also has an important role in the treatment ofthe patient with disseminated disease, particularly if itinvolves the skeleton. Radiation therapy can effect paincontrol and prevention of fracture in this circumstance.\\nDRUG THERAPY. Many breast cancers, particularly\\nthose originating in post-menopausal women, areresponsive to hormones. These cancers have receptors ontheir cells for estrogen and progesterone. Part of primarytumor assessment after removal of the tumor is the evalu-ation for the presence of these estrogen and progesteronereceptors. If they are present on the cancer cells, alteringthe hormone status of the patient will inhibit tumorgrowth and have a positive impact on survival. The drugtamoxifen binds up these receptors on the cancer cells sothat the hormones can’t have an effect and, in so doing,inhibits tumor growth. If the patient has these receptorspresent, tamoxifen is commonly prescribed for five yearsas an adjunct to primary treatment. Adjuvant hormonaltherapy with tamoxifen has few side effects but they haveto be kept in mind, particularly the need for yearly evalu-ation of the uterus. Other agents directed at altering hor-mone environment are under study. Because of these\\nagents, there is rarely any need for surgical removal ofhormone-producing glands, such as the ovary or adrenal,that was sometimes necessary in the past.\\nShortly after the modified radical mastectomy\\nreplaced the radical mastectomy as primary surgicaltreatment, it was appreciated that survival after localtreatment in stage II breast cancer was improved by theaddition of chemotherapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy for aninterval of four to six months is now standard treatmentfor patients with stage II disease. The addition of sys-temic therapy to local treatment in patients who have noevidence of disease is performed on the basis that somepatients have metastasis that are not currently demonstra-ble because they are microscopic. By treating the wholepatient early, before widespread disease is diagnosed, theadjuvant treatment improves survival rates from roughly60% for stage II to about 75% at five years after treat-ment. The standard regimen of cytoxan, methotrexate,and 5-flourouracil, (CMF), is given for six months and iswell tolerated. The regimen of cytoxan, adriamycin (dox-orubicin), and 5-floururacil, (CAF), is a bit more toxicbut only requires four months. (Adriamycin and cytoxinmay also be used alone, without the fluorouracil.) Thetwo methods are about equivalent in results. Adjuvanthormonal therapy may be added to the adjuvant chemo-therapy as they work through different routes.\\nAs one would expect, the encouraging results from\\nadjuvant therapy in stage II disease have led to the studyof similar therapy in stage I disease. The results are notas dramatic, but they are real. Currently, stage I disease isdivided into categories a, b, and c on the basis of tumorsize. Stage Ia is less than a centimeter in diameter. Adju-vant hormonal or chemotherapy is now commonly rec-ommended for stage Ib and Ic patients. The toxicity ofthe treatment must be weighed individually for thepatient as patients with stage I disease have a survivor-ship of over 80% without adjuvant chemotherapy.\\nIf patients are diagnosed with stage IV disease or, in\\nspite of treatment, progress to a state of widespread dis-ease, systemic chemotherapy is utilized in a moreaggressive fashion. In addition to the adriamycin-con-taining regimens, the taxols (docetaxel and paclitaxel)have been found to be effective in inducing remission.\\nOn the basis of prognostic factors such as total num-\\nber of involved nodes over 10, aneuploid DNA with ahigh synthesis value, or aggressive findings on micro-scopic evaluation, some patients with stage II or III dis-ease can be predicted to do poorly. If their performancestatus allows, they can be considered for treatment withhighly aggressive chemotherapy. The toxicity is such thatbone marrow failure will result.

TheNational Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project(NSABP) with support from the National Cancer Insti-tute began a study in 1992 (called the Breast Cancer Pre-vention Trial, or BCPT) studying the use of tamoxifen asa breast cancer preventative for high-risk women. Theresults yielded from the study showed that tamoxifen sig-nificantly reduced breast cancer risk, and the U.S. Foodand Drug Administration approved the use of tamoxifento reduce breast cancer risk for high-risk patients in1998. Another NSABP study, known as STAR, is seek-ing to understand if another drug, raloxifene, is as effec-tive as tamoxifen in reducing breast cancer risk in high-risk patients. That study was begun in 1999, and partici-pants are to be monitored for five years.\\nNeo-adjuvant therapies to allow the use of breast\\npreservation in those with more advanced local diseaseare under investigation.\\nImmune therapies have not been helpful to date\\nthough there are vaccines being developed against pro-teins such as that produced by HER-2 that may be bene-ficial in the future.High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow rescue\\nremains controversial. Factors can be identified that pre-dict certain patients will develop metastatic disease. Thistreatment has been offered to this select group of patientsbut the toxicity is such that defining a clear indication forthis treatment remains under study.\\nPrevention\\nAs mentioned above, because of the results yielded\\nfrom the BCPT clinical trial, tamoxifen can now be pre-scribed to high-risk women to help prevent breast cancer.\\nAnd, while most breast cancer can’t be prevented, it\\ncan be diagnosed from a mammogram at an early stagewhen it is most treatable. The results of awareness androutine screening have allowed earlier diagnosis, whichresults in a better prognosis for those discovered.\\nSpecial Concerns\\nThough breast-preserving therapy is being done more\\nfrequently than in years past, modified radical mastectomyremains an option when selecting therapy for the primarytumor. This option may allow treatment without radiationin earlier stage patients, or may be necessary if the presen-tation of the tumor does not allow breast preservation. Lossof the breast is disfiguring and many patients so treateddesire reconstruction of the breast. Breast reconstruction\\nis performed either at the time of initial surgery (immedi-ate) or it may be delayed. Alternatives include placement ofimplants or the rotation of muscle flaps from the abdomenor back. Most agree that breast preservation gives superiorresults to any form of reconstruction. When the breast isremoved as part of primary therapy, these reconstructionsare available and do produce very reasonable results.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAbelhoff, Armitage, Lichter, Niederhuber.

Breast-shaped sacks made of a sili-cone outer shell and filled with silicone gel or saline (saltwater), called implants, are used.\\nPurpose\\nBreast implantation is usually performed to make\\nnormal breasts larger for cosmetic purposes. Sometimesa woman having a breast reconstruction after a mastec-\\ntomy will need the opposite breast enlarged to make thebreasts more symmetric. Breasts that are very unequal in\\nsize due to trauma or congenital deformity may also becorrected with an enlargement procedure.\\nPrecautions\\nA woman in poor health or with a severe chronic\\ndisease is not a good candidate for this procedure.\\nDescription\\nA cosmetic breast enlargement is usually an outpa-\\ntient procedure. It may be done under local or generalanesthesia, depending on patient and physician prefer-ence. The incision is made through the armpit, under thebreast, or around the areola (the darkened area aroundthe nipple). These techniques create the most inconspicu-ous scars. The implant is placed between the breast tissueand underlying chest muscle, or under the chest muscle.The operation takes approximately one to two hours.

However, if enlargement is part of breast recon-\\nstruction after a mastectomy, health plans may pay forsome or all of it. The surgeon’s fee ranges from $2,700-$4,200 and up. The procedure may also be called breastaugmentation or augmentation mammaplasty.\\nPreparation\\nBefore the surgery is performed, the woman should\\nhave a clear understanding of what her new breasts willlook like. She and her physician should agree about thedesired final result. Many surgeons find it helpful to havethe patient review before and after pictures, to clarifyexpectations.\\nAftercare\\nDriving and normal activities may be restricted for\\nup to one week. Stitches are usually removed in seven to10 days. Typically, a woman can resume all routines,including vigorous exercise , in about three weeks. The\\nscars will be red for approximately one month, but willfade to their final appearance within one or two years.\\nRisks\\nRisks which are common to any surgical procedure\\ninclude bleeding, infection, anesthesia reaction, or unex-pected scarring. A breast enlargement may also result indecreased sensation in the breast, or interference withbreast-feeding. Implants can also make it more difficultto read and interpret mammograms, possibly delayingbreast cancer detection. Also, the implant itself can rup-\\nture and leak, or become displaced. A thick scar that nor-mally forms around the implant, called a capsule, canbecome very hard. This is called capsular contracture,and may result in pain and/or an altered appearance of\\nthe breast. The older the implant, the greater the chancesthat these problems will occur.\\nThere has been intermittent publicity about possible\\nhealth risks from breast implants. Most concerns havefocused on silicone gel-filled implants. As of 1992, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA) restricted the use ofthis type of implant, and ordered further studies. Todayonly saline-filled implants are used for cosmetic breastsurgery. Recent studies have shown no evidence long-term health risks from silicone implants.

Reconstructions arecommonly done after one or both breasts are removed asa treatment for breast cancer . Also, a breast may need to\\nbe refashioned for other reasons, such as trauma orabnormalities that occur during breast development.\\nPurpose\\nMany authorities consider reconstruction an integral\\npart of the therapy for breast cancer . A breast that\\nappears natural offers a sense of wholeness and normal-cy, which can aid in the psychological recovery frombreast cancer. It eliminates the need for an external pros-thesis (false breast), which many women find physicallyuncomfortable as well as inconvenient.\\nPrecautions\\nNot all women are good candidates for breast recon-\\nstruction. Overall poor physical health, or specific prob-lems such as cigarette smoking ,obesity , high blood\\npressure, or diabetes, will increase the chance of compli-cations.

Thereconstructed breast cannot be exactly like the original.\\nThe first step is to form a structure called a breast\\nmound. This can be accomplished using artificial materialscalled breast implants , or by using tissues from other parts\\nof the woman’s body. The second step involves creating abalance between the newly constructed breast and thebreast on the opposite side. The nipple and areolar complex(darker area around the nipple) are recreated. This is usual-ly done several months after the mound is created, to allowswelling to go down. Other procedures may be necessary,such as lifting the opposite breast (mastopexy), or makingit larger or smaller to match the reconstructed breast.\\nTiming, immediate or delayed reconstruction\\nWhile immediate reconstruction (IR) is not recom-\\nmended for women with breast cancer who need to under-go other, more important treatments, breast reconstructioncan be done almost anytime. It even can be done during thesame procedure as the mastectomy , or it can be delayed.\\nThere are psychological benefits to IR. The ability to returnto normal activities and routines is often enhanced whenreconstruction follows immediately after mastectomy. Abetter appearance may result from IR. There is less skinremoval, often resulting in a shorter scar. The surgeon isbetter able to preserve the normal boundaries of the breast,so it is easier to match the opposite breast more closely.\\nThe cost of IR is generally lower than the cost of\\ndelayed reconstruction (DR). There is one fewer opera-tion and hospital stay. Surgeon’s fees may be lower for acombined procedure than for two separate surgeries.\\nThere are disadvantages of IR as well. The surgery\\nitself is longer, causing more time under anesthesia.Post-operative pain and recovery time will be greater\\nthan for mastectomy alone.\\nOther authorities contend that delayed reconstruc-\\ntion (DR) offers different physical and psychologicaladvantages. The initial mastectomy procedure alonetakes less time, and has a shorter recovery period and lesspain than mastectomy and IR. The patient has more timeto adjust to her diagnosis and recover from additionaltherapy. She is better able to research her options, and toformulate realistic goals for reconstruction. Some recon-structive surgery requires blood transfusions. With DR,the patient can donate her own blood ahead of time(autologous transfusion ), and/or arrange to have family\\nand friends donate blood for her use (directed donation).\\nThe psychological stress of living without a breast is\\na disadvantage of DR. The extra procedure DR entailsresults in higher costs. Although initial recovery is faster,an additional recuperation period is required after the\\ndelayed operation.\\nType of reconstruction\\nThere are two basic choices for breast reconstruc-\\ntion. The breast tissue can be replaced with an implant orthe breast is created using some of the woman’s own tis-sues (autologous reconstruction).\\nARTIFICIAL IMPLANTS. In general, implant proce-\\ndures take less time, and are less expensive than autolo-gous ones. Implants are breast shaped pouches. They aremade of silicone outer shells, which may be smooth ortextured. The inside may contain silicone gel, saline (saltwater), or a combination of both.\\nAn implant may be a fixed volume type, which can-\\nnot change its size. Implants that have the capacity to befilled after insertion are called tissue expanders. Thesemay be temporary or permanent.\\nThe initial procedure for any implant insertion uses\\nthe mastectomy incision to make a pocket of tissue, usu-ally underneath the chest wall muscle. In DR, the mas-tectomy scar may be re opened and used for this purpose,or a more cosmetic incision may be made. The implant isinserted into the pocket, the skin is stretched as neededand stitched closed.\\nIf there is inadequate tissue to achieve the desired size,\\nor a naturally sagging breast is desired, a tissue expander isused. It resembles a partially deflated balloon, with anattached valve or port through which saline can be injected.After the initial surgical incision is healed, the womanreturns to the doctor’s office, on a weekly or bi-weeklybasis, to have small amounts of saline injected. Injectionscan continue for about six to eight weeks, until the preferredsize is obtained. In some cases it may be overfilled, and laterpartially deflated to allow for a more pliable, natural result.A temporary tissue expander will be removed after severalmonths and replaced with a permanent implant.\\nIR surgery using an implant takes approximately\\ntwo to three hours, and usually requires up to a three dayhospital stay. Implant insertion surgery, as part of DR,takes one to two hours and can sometimes be done as anoutpatient, or it or it may entail overnight hospitalization.\\nAUTOLOGUS RECONSTRUCTION. Attached flap and\\nfree flap are two types of surgery where a woman’s tissueis used in reconstruction. An attached flap uses skin, mus-cle, and fat, leaving blood vessels attached to their origi-nal source of blood. The flap is maneuvered to the recon-struction site, keeping its original blood supply for nour-ishment. This may also be known as a pedicle flap. Thesecond kind of surgery is called a free flap. This also usesskin, muscle, and fat, but severs the blood vessels, and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 587Breast reconstructionGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 587'),\n",

The surgeon uses a microscope to accomplishthis delicate task of sewing blood vessels together. Some-times the term microsurgery is used to refer to free flapprocedures. Either type of surgery may also be called amyocutaneous flap, referring to the skin and muscle used.\\nThe skin and muscle used in autologous reconstruc-\\ntion can come from one of several possible places on thebody, including the abdomen (TRAM flap or “tummytuck”), the back (latissimus dorsi flap), or the buttocks(gluteus maximus free flap).\\nFinishing the reconstruction\\nOther procedures may be necessary to achieve the goal\\nof symmetrical breasts. It may be necessary to make theopposite breast larger (augmentation), smaller (reduction),\\nor higher (mastopexy). These, or any other refinementsshould be completed before the creation of a nipple andareola. Tissue to form the new nipple may come from thereconstructed breast itself, the opposite breast, or a moredistant donor site, such as the inner thigh or behind the ear.The nipple and areolar construction is usually an outpatientprocedure. A final step, often done in the doctor’s office, istattooing the new nipple and areola, to match the color ofthe opposite nipple and areola as closely as possible.\\nInsurance\\nInsurance coverage for breast reconstruction varies\\nwidely.

Breast\\nreconstruction will not resolve a psychological problemthe woman had before mastectomy, nor make an unstablerelationship strong. An expectation of physical perfectionis unrealistic. A woman who cites any of these reasonsfor reconstruction shows that she has not been adequate-ly informed or prepared. Complete understanding of thebenefits and limitations of this surgery is necessary for asatisfactory result.\\nAftercare\\nThe length of the hospital stay, recovery period, and\\nfrequency of visits to the doctor after surgery varies consid-erably with the different kinds of reconstruction. In general,autologous procedures require longer hospitalization andrecovery time than implant procedures. Bandages anddrainage tubes remain in place for at least a day for all surg-eries. Microsurgical or free flaps are most closely moni-tored in the first day or two after surgery. The circulation tothe breast may be checked as often as every hour. Completebreast reconstruction requires at least one additionalsurgery to create a nipple and areola. Scars may remain redand raised for a month or longer. The true, final appearanceof the breasts will not be visible for at least one year.\\nRisks\\nSome women have reported various types of autoim-\\nmune related connective-tissue disorders, which theyattribute to their implants usually involving silicone gelimplants.

By regularly examining her own breasts, awoman is more likely to find any changes that may haveoccurred. The best time to perform a BSE is about a weekafter a woman’s period ends, when her breasts are not ten-der or swollen. If her periods are not regular, a BSEshould be completed on the same day every month. ABSE should also be regularly completed by women whoare pregnant, breastfeeding, or have breast implants . By\\ncombining a BSE with a mammography and clinical\\nbreast examination, a woman is offered the best opportu-nity for reducing chances of death from breast cancer\\nthrough early detection. Close to 90% of breast cancersare found through a BSE. The American Cancer Societyrecommends that beginning at the age of 20, women com-plete a BSE each month by feeling for lumps or anythingsuspicious, as well as looking at their breasts carefully ina mirror for any changes in contour, swelling, dimpling,puckering of the skin, or changes in the nipple.\\nDescription\\nTo complete a monthly BSE:\\n• When lying down, place a pillow under the right shoul-\\nder and position the right arm behind the head.

The sound waves pass through thebreast and bounce back or echo from various tissues toform a picture of the internal structures. It is not invasiveand involves no radiation.\\nPurpose\\nBreast ultrasound may be used in several ways. The\\nmost common application is to investigate a specific areaof the breast where a problem is suspected. A palpablelump and/or a lump or density discovered by x ray(mammogram) can be further evaluated by ultrasound. Itis especially helpful in distinguishing between a fluid-filled cyst and a solid mass. It can also identify smalllesions that are too tiny to be felt.\\nBreast ultrasound is often the first study performed to\\nevaluate masses in women under 35 whose mammogramscan be difficult to interpret due to the density of theirbreast tissue. The lack of radiation used with ultrasoundmakes it ideal for studying breast abnormalities in womenwho are pregnant. Assessing breast implants for leakage\\nor rupture is another way ultrasound is used. Breastinflammation, where pockets of infection or abscessesmay form, can be diagnosed and monitored by ultrasound.\\nThickened and swollen breast skin may be a sign of\\ninflammatory breast cancer . Ultrasound can sometimes\\nidentify a cancerous growth within the breast causing thethickened skin. These cases are usually followed by acore biopsy guided by ultrasound (described below).\\nBreast ultrasound is employed to observe and guide a\\nneedle for several interventional procedures.

Patients usuallyfind that the procedure is less traumatic and more comfort-able than surgical biopsies. Ultrasound is known for itsaccuracy in determining how far a cancerous growthextends into the surrounding tissue in lesions that cannot befelt. Biopsies guided by ultrasound are generally less costlythan surgical biopsies. Additionally, if the abnormality thatrequires biopsy can be seen on both a mammogram andultrasound, an ultrasound-guided biopsy is often morecomfortable for the patient as no compression is necessary.\\nDescription\\nUltrasound can be done in a doctor’s office or anoth-\\ner outpatient setting, such as a hospital or imaging center.\\nThe patient removes her clothing from the waist up\\nand puts on a hospital gown, open in the front. She lieson her back or side on an examining table. A gel thatenhances sound transmission is spread over the area to beexamined. The technologist then places a transducer, aninstrument about the size of an electric shaver, againstthe skin. The images from reflected sound waves appearon a monitor screen.\\nA good ultrasound study is difficult to obtain if the\\npatient is unable to remain quietly in one position. Obe-\\nsitymay hinder clear viewing of internal structures, and\\nthe accuracy of an ultrasound study is highly dependenton the skill of the person performing the examination.The images recorded vary with the angle and pressure ofthe transducer and the equipment settings.

The fetusis upside down in the uterus, and the head will lead theway during the birth process.\\nUnfortunately, some fetuses do not cooperate. Most\\nof these are in the breech position. The buttocks lead theway out of the uterus, and the legs are folded in front ofthe body (frank breech). Delivery from the breech posi-tion poses far more risks than delivery head first (vertexposition).\\nThe biggest part of the fetus’s body is usually its\\nhead. If the head fits through the mother’s pelvis, thenthe rest of the fetus’s body should slip out fairly easily. Ifthe fetus is born bottom first, it is possible that the bodywill fit through the mother’s pelvis, but the baby’s headwill get stuck at the level of the chin. This condition,known as a trapped head, is very dangerous.\\nWhen the baby’s head comes first, it has a chance to\\n“mold” during labor. The bones of the baby’s skull arenot yet fastened together the way they are in a child oradult’s skull, meaning that the bones of the baby’s skullcan move. During the long hours of labor the skull canchange shape to fit through the pelvis more easily, whichis why many babies are born with a “cone head”. If thebaby is born from the breech position, the skull does nothave a chance to change shape to fit the pelvis, and it iseven more likely to get stuck.\\nIf the baby’s head gets trapped, the possibility of\\ninjury is high. Once the baby’s body is born, the umbilicalcord usually stops pulsating (just as it would during a nor-mal delivery). This cuts off the oxygen supply from themother to the baby. If the baby’s head is still inside theuterus the baby cannot yet breathe on its own. Therefore,it is essential to deliver the baby as quickly as possible.\\nThe life saving attempts to deliver the baby’s head\\ncan cause injury to the baby’s neck or head resulting inpermanent handicaps. In extreme cases, if the baby can-not be delivered within a few minutes, the baby mightdie. Obviously, it is critical to avoid a breech deliverywith a trapped head.\\nOf course, many babies are safely delivered from the\\nbreech position. There are certain factors that make abreech delivery more likely to be successful: if ultra-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 594Breech birthGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 594'),\n",

This is not true forpremature babies. Premature babies are more likely to havea trapped head because the body of a premature baby isusually much smaller than his or her head. Prematurebabies are generally not delivered from the breech position.\\nThe risks of vaginal breech delivery can be avoided by\\ndelivering the baby through a surgical procedure ( cesarean\\nsection , also known as c-section). For the past twenty\\nyears, cesarean section has been recommended when thefetus is breech. More recently, many providers have offeredthe option of version, attempting to turn the fetus within theuterus to a head first position before labor begins.\\nVersion is based on a very simple idea. If a fetus in\\nthe breech position does a somersault, it will end up headdown. During a version, the obstetrician tries to make thefetus do a somersault.\\nA version should only be done in a hospital, with an\\nultrasound machine used to guide the obstetrician inturning the fetus. The fetus should be monitored with afetal monitor before and after the version. Some obstetri-cians give the mother an injection of medication to relaxthe mother’s uterus and prevent any contractions.\\nDuring the procedure, the obstetrician places his or\\nher hands on the mother’s abdomen to feel the location ofthe unborn baby’s buttocks and head. The buttocks arelifted up slightly and the doctor pushes on the baby’shead to encourage him to perform a somersault. It maytake several tries before the fetus cooperates, but overhalf will eventually turn.\\nA version is not appropriate for every fetus who is in\\nthe breech position at the end of pregnancy. It can only betried if there is one fetus in the uterus, if the placenta is notlying in front of the fetus, and if the umbilical cord doesnot appear to be wrapped around the fetus at any point.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe cause of breech birth is not known. There are\\ngenerally no identifiable symptoms. However, somewomen can tell the position of the fetus by where theyfeel the fetus kicking. Most women cannot tell whatposition the fetus is in at any given moment.\\nDiagnosis\\nA health care provider can often tell the position of\\nthe fetus by feeling it through the wall of the mother’sabdomen. Another clue to the position is the location\\nwhere the heartbeat is heard best. If the fetus’s heartbeatis best heard below the level of the mother’s navel, it islikely to be positioned head first. On the other hand, ifthe heartbeat is best heard above the level of the navel, itis likely to be breech.\\nThe only way to really be sure, however, is to do an\\nultrasound exam. Using this technique it is very easy totell the position of the fetus.\\nTreatment\\nIf a fetus is in the breech position in the last weeks of\\npregnancy, there are three possible courses of action: Cesare-an section, attempted version, or vaginal breech delivery.\\nCesarean section is the most common way to deliver\\na breech baby. This surgical procedure carries more riskfor the mother, but many women prefer to take the risk ofsurgery on themselves rather than let the baby face therisks of breech delivery.\\nVersion is gaining in popularity. Version is a medical\\nprocedure in which the obstetrician tries to turn thebreech fetus to the head first position. Version is success-ful more than 50% of the time. However, some babieswho are successfully turned will turn back to the breechposition after the procedure is done.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 595Breech birth\\nPlacenta\\nUterus\\nUmbilical cord\\nBreech Birth\\nApproximately 3-4% of babies will start labor in the breech\\n(buttocks first) position.

In bronchiectasis, the diameter of the bronchi isunusually large. Examination of the walls of the bronchialtubes reveals destruction of the normal structural elements,with replacement by scar tissue. Pus collects within thebronchi, and the normal flow of oxygen into the lungs, andcarbon dioxide out of the lungs (air exchange) is impaired.The bronchi show signs of inflammation, with swellingand invasion by a variety of immune cells. The inflamedareas show signs of increased growth of blood vessels. Thearea of the lung which should be served by a diseasedbronchial tube is also prone to inflammation and infection.Causes and symptoms\\nPrior to the widespread use of immunizations,\\nbronchiectasis was often the result of a serious infectionwith either measles or whooping cough . Currently,\\nviruses that cause influenza (flu) or influenza-like syn-\\ndromes, as well as a number of bacteria may precede thedevelopment of bronchiectasis. Patients who have beeninfected with tuberculosis or the virus which causes\\nAIDS (HIV or human immunodeficiency virus) also\\nhave an increased chance of bronchiectasis.\\nA number of pre-existing conditions may cause an\\nindividual to be more susceptible than normal to infec-tion, with increased risk of bronchiectasis developing.These conditions include disorders of cilia, and immunedisorders.\\nCilia are the tiny hairs which usually line the\\nbronchial tubes. Cilia wave constantly, sweeping thebronchial tubes clean of bacterial or viral invaders, andcleaning away excess secretions (mucus, sputum) whichmay be produced by the bronchi. When these cilia areabnormal or absent at birth, various bacterial or viralinvaders may remain in the respiratory tract, multiply,and cause serious infections.\\nImmune disorders include decreased production of\\ncertain immune chemicals (immunoglobulins) whichusually serve to fight off infection by bacterial or viralinvasion. When these immunoglobulins are not producedin large enough quantity, bacterial and viral invaders arenot effectively killed off, and infection occurs.\\nOther causes of bronchiectasis include an abnormal-\\nly blocked (obstructed) airway. This can be due to tumorgrowth within the bronchial tube, or due to a child acci-dentally inhaling a small object which then blocks off thebronchial tube. People with the disease called cystic\\nfibrosis (CF) often have their bronchial tubes obstructed\\nby the thick, sticky mucus which is a hallmark of CF.Toxic exposures (breathing ammonia, for example) canharm the bronchi, and lead to bronchiectasis. An extremeallergic response of the immune system to the presenceof certain fungi (especially one called Aspergillus ) can\\nalso damage the bronchial tubes enough to result inbronchiectasis.\\nSymptoms of bronchiectasis include constant cough\\nand the production of infected sputum (sputum is a mix-ture of mucus and pus), which may be bloody. In somecases, there may be wheezing and shortness of breath .\\nThe constant, low-level of infection may flare, resultingin increased production of sputum, worsening of thecough, and fever . The area of the lung served by the\\naffected bronchial tube may become severely infected,resulting in pneumonia .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 596BronchiectasisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 596'),\n",

Bronchitis can either be ofbrief duration (acute) or have a long course (chronic).Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a viral infection, butcan also be caused by a bacterial infection and can healwithout complications. Chronic bronchitis is a sign of seri-ous lung disease that may be slowed but cannot be cured.\\nDescription\\nAlthough acute and chronic bronchitis are both\\ninflammations of the air passages, their causes and treat-ments are different. Acute bronchitis is most prevalent inwinter. It usually follows a viral infection, such as a coldor the flu, and can be accompanied by a secondary bacter-ial infection. Acute bronchitis resolves within two weeks,although the cough may persist longer. Acute bronchitis,\\nlike any upper airway inflammatory process, can increasea person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia .\\nAnyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, young\\nchildren, and the elderly are more likely to get the dis-ease because people in these age groups generally haveweaker immune systems. Smokers and people with heartor other lung diseases are also at higher risk of develop-ing acute bronchitis. Individuals exposed to chemicalfumes or high levels of air pollution also have a greaterchance of developing acute bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is a major cause of disability and\\ndeath in the United States. The American Lung Associa-\\ntion estimates that about 14 million Americans sufferfrom the disease. Like acute bronchitis, chronic bronchi-tis is an inflammation of airways accompanied by cough-ing and spitting up of phlegm. In chronic bronchitis,these symptoms are present for at least three months ineach of two consecutive years.\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling bronchial\\nirritants, especially cigarette smoke. Until recently, moremen than women developed chronic bronchitis, but asthe number of women who smoke has increased, so hastheir rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease pro-gresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are morelikely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that\\nfall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-ease (COPD). Other diseases in this category includeemphysema and chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronic\\nbronchitis may progress to emphysema, or both diseasesmay be present together.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nAcute bronchitis\\nAcute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms\\nof a cold, such as a runny nose, sneezing, and dry cough.However, the cough soon becomes deep and painful.\\nCoughing brings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum.These symptoms may be accompanied by a fever of up\\nto 102°F (38.8°C). Wheezing after coughing is common.\\nIn uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and\\nmost other symptoms, except the cough, disappear afterthree to five days. Coughing may continue for severalweeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacter-ial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel-ing of illness persist. To be cured, the bacterial infectionshould be treated with antibiotics .\\nChronic bronchitis\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory\\ntract irritants. The most common irritant is cigarettesmoke. The American Lung Association estimates that80-90% of COPD cases are caused by smoking . Other\\nirritants include chemical fumes, air pollution, and envi-ronmental irritants, such as mold or dust.\\nChronic bronchitis develops slowly over time. The\\ncells that line the respiratory system contain fine, hair-like outgrowths from the cell called cilia. Normally, thecilia of many cells beat rhythmically to move mucusalong the airways. When smoke or other irritants areinhaled, the cilia become paralyzed or snap off. Whenthis occurs, the cilia are no longer able to move mucus,and the airways become inflamed, narrowed, andclogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and canprogress to the life-threatening disease emphysema.\\nA mild cough, sometimes called smokers’ cough, is\\nusually the first visible sign of chronic bronchitis.Coughing brings up phlegm, although the amount variesconsiderably from person to person. Wheezing andshortness of breath may accompany the cough. Diag-\\nnostic tests show a decrease in lung function. As the dis-ease advances, breathing becomes difficult and activitydecreases. The body does not get enough oxygen, lead-ing to changes in the composition of the blood.\\nDiagnosis\\nInitial diagnosis of bronchitis is based on observing\\nthe patient’s symptoms and health history. The physicianwill listen to the patient’s chest with a stethoscope forspecific sounds that indicate lung inflammation, such asmoist rales and crackling, and wheezing, that indicatesairway narrowing. Moist rales is a bubbling sound heardwith a stethoscope that is caused by fluid secretion in thebronchial tubes.\\nA sputum culture may be performed, particularly if\\nthe sputum is green or has blood in it, to determine whethera bacterial infection is present and to identify the disease-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 598BronchitisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 598'),\n",

Normally, the patient will be asked to coughdeeply, then spit the material that comes up from the lungs(sputum) into a cup. This sample is then grown in the labo-ratory to determine which organisms are present. Theresults are available in two to three days, except for tests fortuberculosis , which can take as long as two months.\\nOccasionally, in diagnosing a chronic lung disorder,\\nthe sample of sputum is collected using a procedurecalled a bronchoscopy . In this procedure, the patient is\\ngiven a local anesthetic, and a tube is passed into the air-ways to collect a sputum sample.\\nA pulmonary function test is important in diagnos-\\ning chronic bronchitis and other variations of COPD.This test uses an instrument called a spirometer to mea-sure the volume of air entering and leaving the lungs.The test is done in the doctor’s office and is painless. Itinvolves breathing into the spirometer mouthpiece eithernormally or forcefully. V olumes less than 80% of thenormal values indicate an obstructive lung disease.\\nTo better determine what type of obstructive lung\\ndisease a patient has, the doctor may do a chest x ray ,\\nelectrocardiogram (ECG), and blood tests. An electrocar-diogram is an instrument that is used to measure the elec-trical activity of the heart and is useful in the diagnosis ofheart conditions. Other tests may be used to measure howeffectively oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged inthe lungs.\\nTreatment\\nAcute bronchitis\\nWhen no secondary infection is present, acute bron-\\nchitis is treated in the same way as the common cold .\\nHome care includes drinking plenty of fluids, resting, notsmoking, increasing moisture in the air with a cool misthumidifier, and taking acetaminophen (Datril, Tylenol,\\nPanadol) for fever and pain .

Nor-mally, air moves smoothly from the mouth and nosethrough the airways and into the tiny air sacs of the lungsas a person breathes in. Breathing out (exhaling) happensautomatically when the person stops breathing in. In aperson with asthma, breathing in (inhaling) is not a prob-lem. Incoming air can slide around the blockage, becausethe act of breathing in makes the airways expand. Theproblem comes when the person with asthma tries tobreathe out. The air can no longer get past the blockage,and it remains trapped in the lungs. The person can thenonly take shallow breaths. Bronchodilators work byrelaxing the smooth muscles that line the airways. Thismakes the airways open wider and allows air to leave thelungs. These drugs also are used to relieve breathingproblems associated with emphysema , chronic bronchi-\\ntis, and other lung diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 600BronchodilatorsGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 600'),\n",

This scopecontains a viewing device that allows the visual examina-tion of the lower airways.\\nPurpose\\nDuring a bronchoscopy, a physician can visually\\nexamine the lower airways, including the larynx, trachea,bronchi, and bronchioles. The procedure is used to exam-ine the mucosal surface of the airways for abnormalitiesthat might be associated with a variety of lung diseases.Its use includes the visualization of airway obstructionssuch as a tumor, or the collection of specimens for thediagnosis of cancer originating in the bronchi of the\\nlungs (bronchogenic cancer). It can also be used to collectspecimens for culture to diagnose infectious diseases suchas tuberculosis . The type of specimens collected can\\ninclude sputum (composed of saliva and discharges fromthe respiratory passages), tissue samples from the bronchior bronchioles, or cells collected from washing the liningof the bronchi or bronchioles. The instrument used inbronchoscopy, a bronchoscope, is a slender cylindricalinstrument containing a light and an eyepiece. There aretwo types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube that is some-times referred to as an open-tube or ventilating broncho-scope, and a more flexible fiberoptic tube. This tube con-tains four smaller passages—two for light to passthrough, one for seeing through and one that can accom-modate medical instruments that may be used for biopsyor suctioning, or that medication can be passed through.\\nBronchoscopy may be used for the following pur-\\nposes:\\n• to diagnose cancer, tuberculosis, lung infection, or\\nother lung disease\\n• to examine an inherited deformity of the lungs\\n• to remove a foreign body in the lungs, such as a mucus\\nplug, tumor, or excessive secretions\\n• to remove tissue samples, also known as biopsy, to test\\nfor cancer cells, help with staging the advancement ofthe lung cancer, or to treat a tumor with laser therapy\\n• to allow examination of a suspected tumor, obstruction,\\nsecretion, bleeding, or foreign body in the airways\\n• to determine the cause of a persistent cough ,wheezing ,\\nor a cough that includes blood in the sputum\\n• to evaluate the effectiveness of lung cancer treatments\\nPrecautions\\nPatients not breathing adequately on their own due\\nto severe respiratory failure may require mechanical\\nventilation prior to bronchoscopy. It may not be appro-priate to perform bronchoscopy on patients with anunstable heart condition. All patients must be constantlymonitored while undergoing a bronchoscopy so that anyabnormal reactions can be dealt with immediately.\\nDescription\\nThere are two types of bronchoscopes, a rigid tube\\nand a fiberoptic tube.

However, if the purpose of the\\nprocedure is to remove a foreign body caught in the wind-pipe or lungs of a child, the more rigid tube must be usedbecause of its larger size. The patient will either lie face-upon his/her back or sit upright in a chair. Medication todecrease secretions, lessen anxiety , and relax the patient\\nare often given prior to the procedure. While breathingthrough the nose, anesthesia is sprayed into the mouth ornose to numb it. It will take one to two minutes for theanesthesia to take effect. Once this happens, the broncho-scope will be put into the patient’s mouth or nose andmoved down into the throat. While the bronchoscope ismoving down the throat, additional anesthesia is put intothe bronchoscope to numb the lower parts of the airways.Using the eyepiece, the physician then observes the tra-chea and bronchi, and the mucosal lining of these passage-ways, looking for any abnormalities that may be present.\\nIf the purpose of the bronchoscopy is to take tissue\\nsamples or biopsy, forceps or a bronchial brush are usedto obtain cells. If the purpose is to identify an infectiousagent, a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can be used togather fluid for culture purposes. Also, if any foreignmatter is found in the airways, it can be removed.\\nAnother procedure using bronchoscopy is called flu-\\norescence bronchoscopy. This can be used to detect pre-cancerous cells present in the airways. By using a fluo-\\nrescent light in the bronchoscope, precancerous tissuewill appear dark red, while healthy tissue will appeargreen. This technique can help detect lung cancer at anearly stage, so that treatment can be started early.\\nAlternative procedures\\nDepending upon the purpose of the bronchoscopy,\\nalternatives might include a computed tomography scan(CT) or no procedure at all. Bronchoscopy is often per-formed to investigate an abnormality that shows up on achest x ray or CT scan. If the purpose is to obtain biopsy\\nspecimens, one option is to perform surgery, which carriesgreater risks. Another option is percutaneous (through theskin) biopsy guided by computed tomography.\\nPreparation\\nThe doctor should be informed of any allergies and\\nall the medications that the patient is currently taking. Thedoctor may instruct the patient not to take medicationslike aspirin or anti-inflammatory drugs, which interfere\\nwith clotting, for a period of time prior to the procedure.The patient needs to fast for 6 to 12 hours prior to the pro-cedure and refrain from drinking any liquids the day ofthe procedure. The bronchoscopy takes about 45 to 60minutes, with results usually available in one day. Prior tothe bronchoscopy, several tests may be done, including achest x ray and blood work. Sometimes a bronchoscopy isdone under general anesthesia. Patients usually have anintravenous (IV) line in the arm. Most likely, the proce-dure will be done under local anesthesia, which is sprayedinto the nose or mouth. This is necessary to decrease thegag reflex. A sedative may also be used to help the patientrelax. It is important that the patient understands that at notime will the airway be blocked and that oxygen can besupplied through the bronchoscope. A signed consentform is necessary for this procedure.\\nAftercare\\nAfter the bronchoscopy, the patient will be monitored\\nfor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, andbreathing, while resting in bed. Sometimes patients havean abnormal reaction to anesthesia. All saliva should bespit into a basin so that it can be examined for the pres-ence of blood. If a biopsy was taken, the patient shouldnot cough or clear the throat as this might dislodge anyblood clot that has formed and cause bleeding. No food ordrink should be consumed for about two hours after theprocedure or until the anesthesia wears off. Diet is gradu-ally progressed from ice chips and clear liquids to thepatient’s regular diet. There will also be a temporary sore\\nthroat and hoarseness that may last for a few days.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 604BronchoscopyBronchoscope\\nBronchoscopy is a procedure in which a hollow, flexible\\ntube is inserted into the airways, allowing the physician tovisually examine the lower airways, including the larynx, tra-chea, bronchi, and bronchioles.

Symptoms of the disease includeintermittent fever , sweating, chills, aches, and mental\\ndepression. The disease can become chronic and recur,particularly if untreated.\\nDescription\\nAlso known as undulant fever, Malta fever, Gibraltar\\nfever, Bang’s disease, or Mediterranean fever, brucellosisis most likely to occur among those individuals who reg-ularly work with livestock. The disease originated indomestic livestock but was passed on to wild animalspecies, including the elk and buffalo of the westernUnited States. In humans, brucellosis continues to bespread via unpasteurized milk obtained from infectedcows or through contact with the discharges of cattle andgoats during miscarriage . In areas of the world where\\nmilk is not pasteurized, for example in Latin Americaand the Mediterranean, the disease is still contracted byingesting unpasteurized dairy products. However, in theUnited States, the widespread pasteurization of milk andnearly complete eradication of the infection from cattlehas reduced the number of human cases from 6,500 in1940 to about 70 in 1994.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe disease is caused by several different species of\\nparasitic bacteria of the genus Brucella. B. abortus is\\nfound in cattle and can cause cows to abort their fetuses.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 605BrucellosisGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 605'),\n",

B. melitensis is found in goats and sheep and caus-\\nes the most severe illness in humans. B. rangiferi infects\\nreindeer and caribou, and B. canis is found in dogs.\\nA human contracts the disease by coming into con-\\ntact with an infected animal and either allowing the bac-teria to enter a cut, breathing in the bacteria, or by con-suming unpasteurized milk or fresh goat cheese obtainedfrom a contaminated animal. In the United States, thedisease is primarily confined to slaughterhouse workers.\\nScientists do not agree about whether brucellosis\\ncan be transmitted from one person to another, althoughsome people have been infected from a tainted bloodtransfusion or bone marrow transplant. Newborn babies\\nhave also contracted the illness from their mothers dur-ing birth. Currently, it is believed that brucellosis canalso be transmitted sexually.\\nThe disease is not usually fatal, but the intermittent\\nfevers (a source of its nickname, “undulant fever”) can beexhausting. Symptoms usually appear between five daysand a month after exposure and begin with a single boutof high fever accompanied by shivering, aching, anddrenching sweats that last for a few days. Other symp-toms may include headache , poor appetite, backache,\\nweakness, and depression. Mental depression can be sosevere that the patient may become suicidal.\\nIn rare, untreated cases, the disease can become so\\nsevere that it leads to fatal complications, such as pneu-\\nmonia or bacterial meningitis .

The condition can also occur in a chronic\\nform, in which symptoms recur over a period of monthsor years.KEY TERMS\\nAntibody —A specific protein produced by the\\nimmune system in response to a specific foreignprotein or particle called an antigen.\\nChronic —Disease or condition characterized by\\nslow onset over a long period of time.\\nParasite —An organism living in or on, and obtain-\\ning nourishment from, another organism.\\nPasteurization —The process of applying heat,\\nusually to milk or cheese, for the purpose ofkilling, or retarding the development of, pathogen-ic bacteria.Diagnosis\\nBrucellosis is usually diagnosed by detecting one or\\nmore Brucella species in blood or urine samples. The\\nbacteria may be positively identified using biochemicalmethods or using a technique whereby, if present in thesample, the brucellosis bacteria are made to fluoresce.Brucellosis may also be diagnosed by culturing and iso-lating the bacteria from one of the above samples. Bloodsamples will also indicate elevated antibody levels orincreased amounts of a protein produced directly inresponse to infection with brucellosis bacteria.\\nTreatment\\nProlonged treatment with antibiotics , including\\ntetracyclines (with streptomycin), co-trimoxazole, and\\nsulfonamides , is effective. Bed rest is also imperative. In\\nthe chronic form of brucellosis, the symptoms may recur,requiring a second course of treatment.\\nPrognosis\\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment is essential to\\nprevent chronic infection. Untreated, the disease may lingerfor years, but it is rarely fatal. Relapses may also occur.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no human vaccine for brucellosis, but\\nhumans can be protected by controlling the disease inlivestock. After checking to make sure an animal is notalready infected, and destroying those that are, all live-stock should be immunized. Butchers and those whowork in slaughterhouses should wear protective glassesand clothing, and protect broken skin from infection.\\nSome experts suggest that a person with the disease\\nrefrain from engaging in unprotected sex until free of thedisease.

Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a diseasecondition. A very small bruise is called a petechia. Theseoften appear as many tiny red dots clustered together,and could indicate a serious problem.\\nDescription\\nBruises change colors over time in a predictable pat-\\ntern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injuryoccurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise willbe reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. Afterone to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down,and the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color.This fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth orninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have abrown or yellowish appearance, and it will graduallydiminish back to its normal color.\\nLong periods of standing will cause the blood that\\ncollects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruisesare actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood inone place may flow downhill after awhile and appear inanother. For instance, bruising in the back of theabdomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising inthe thigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nHealthy people may develop bruises from any injury\\nthat doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercise\\nmay also cause bruises due to bringing about small tearsin blood vessels walls. In a condition known as purpurasimplex, there is a tendency to bruise easily due to anincreased fragility of the blood vessels. Bruises alsodevelop easily in the elderly, because the skin and bloodvessels have a tendency to become thinner and morefragile with aging , and there is an increased use of med-\\nications that interfere with the blood clotting system. Inthe condition known as purpura senilis, the elderly devel-op bruises from minimal contact that may take up to sev-eral months to completely heal.\\nThe use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as\\nibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead toincreased bruising. Aspirin , antidepressants, asthma\\nmedications, and cortisone medications also have thiseffect. The anti-clotting medications also known as bloodthinners, especially the drug Warfarin (Coumadin), maybe the cause of particularly severe bruising.\\nSometimes bruises are connected with more serious\\nillnesses. There are a number of diseases that causeexcessive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight tohave consequences in healthy people.

If there are large areas of bruis-ing or bruises develop very easily, this may herald aproblem. Other causes that should be ruled out includeliver disease, alcoholism , drug addiction , and acquired\\nimmune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ). Bruising that\\noccurs around the navel may indicate dangerous internalbleeding; bruising behind the ear, called Battle’s sign,may be due to a skull fracture; and raised bruises maypoint to autoimmune disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nBruising is usually a minor problem, which does not\\nrequire a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten-sive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis-ing in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu-ation that will include a number of blood tests. If the areaof the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required.\\nTreatment\\nA bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is\\noften recommended that ice packs be applied on and offduring the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.After that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommendedto increase the circulation and the healing of the injuredtissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres-sion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation ofblood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannotcompletely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, itmay have to be surgically removed.\\nAlternative treatment\\nSeveral types of topical applications are usually rec-\\nommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain associ-\\nated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied direct-ly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witchhazel, Hamamelis virginiana , can be used. This will\\ntighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising.The homeopathic remedy, Arnica montana , can be\\napplied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.\\nOral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,\\npain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana , at 30 ml (1\\noz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom-mended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times perday is also useful.\\nPrognosis\\nThe blood under the skin which causes the discol-\\noration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by thebody in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin colorshould completely return to normal.Sometimes, a bruise may become solid and increase\\nin size instead of dissolving. This may indicate bloodtrapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained.This is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, thebody may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in aprocess called heterotopic ossification.\\nPrevention\\nVitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood,\\nand therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruiseeasily. Green leafy vegetables, alfalfa, broccoli, seaweed,and fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K. Othergood foods to eat would be those containingbioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These canassist in strengthening the connective tissue, which willdecrease the spread of blood and bruising.

The high pressure of blood in these veins\\nleads to an enlarged liver, and to an accumulation of fluidin the abdomen, called ascites .\\nDescription\\nThe liver, the largest internal organ in the human\\nbody, is responsible for many vital physiologic process-es. Blood flow through the liver nourishes the liver, car-ries in substances that the liver will process, and carriesaway substances that the liver has produced. When bloodcannot flow out freely from the liver, blood pressure risesin the veins of the liver, leading to blood clots within theliver. Also, some of the blood plasma can leak throughthe walls of the veins and accumulate within theabdomen (ascites).\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe major symptoms include pain in the upper\\nright-hand portion of the abdomen and a build-up of fluidin the abdomen. In the United States, blood disorders arethe most common causes. Among these disorders arepolycythemia rubra vera (an increase in the number ofred blood cells), and sickle cell disease . In parts of the\\nworld where liver cancer is common, a form of liver\\ncancer is the most frequent cause.\\nOther causes sometimes include:\\n• certain infections• use of oral contraceptives\\n• body changes in pregnancy and the postpartum period\\n• phlebitis (inflammation of a vein)• injury to the abdomen• membranous webs (especially in Asia)KEY TERMS\\nAscites —Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen.\\nBiopsy —Surgical removal of a tiny bit of tissue for\\nexamination under the microscope.\\nCatheter —A tubular surgical instrument.\\nPhlebitis —Inflammation of a vein.\\nPolycythemia rubra vera —An excess number of\\nred blood cells in the blood.\\nSickle cell disease —An inherited disease in which\\nred blood cells take an unusual shape, leading tocirculation problems.Diagnosis\\nDiagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome can be made by\\nan internist (a specialist in diseases of the internalorgans), a gastroenterologist (a specialist in the diseasesof the digestive system), or a general surgeon. On physi-\\ncal examination , the doctor will note that the liver is\\nlarger than normal. Often an ultrasound scan of the liverwill show abnormalities in the size of the liver, an abnor-mal pattern of the veins in the liver, and other abnormali-ties. A CT scan will often show similar abnormalities.\\nOnce these abnormalities are confirmed, the key test\\nis called hepatic vein catheterization. In this test, a narrowtube is snaked through the body until it reaches the hepat-ic veins. An instrument at the tip of the catheter can mea-sure the pressure within each segment of the hepatic vein.\\nIn some cases, a tiny amount of radioactive material is\\ninjected into a patient, and then an abnormal pattern ofradioactivity in the liver can be revealed. In other cases, aliver biopsy enables a physician to examine cells from the\\nliver itself. Cells damaged by Budd-Chiari syndrome have acharacteristic appearance easily identifiable to a physician.\\nTreatment\\nSurgery\\nMost patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome must\\nhave surgery. A surgeon will re-route blood flow aroundthe clotted hepatic vein into a large vein called the venacava. The exact technique will depend on the specificlocation of the clots and other factors. In certain patients,other surgical techniques may be used. For patients whootherwise would have less than six months to live, liver\\ntransplantation is sometimes performed.\\nIn a few patients, a “balloon catheter” can open the\\nblocked blood vessels, without the need for major surgery.\\nDrugs\\nSometimes, anti-clotting drugs such as urokinase\\ncan be used for patients with a sudden onset of clotting inthe veins of the liver. These drugs do not seem to workwhen the clots have become established.\\nPrognosis\\nIf surgery is done before permanent liver damage sets\\nin, long-term survival is possible. In these cases, damagedliver cells can actually recover. If patients are already verysick with liver disease, the surgery may not be as helpful.\\nPrevention\\nThe best approach to prevention is to carefully control\\nthe blood disorders that can lead to Budd-Chiari syndrome.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 610Budd-Chiari syndromeGEM -0433 to 0624 - B  10/22/03 6:09 PM  Page 610'),\n",

Lampert\\nBuerger’s disease\\nDefinition\\nBuerger’s disease is an inflammation of the arteries,\\nveins, and nerves in the legs, principally, leading torestricted blood flow. Left untreated, Buerger’s diseasecan lead to gangrene of the affected areas. Buerger’s dis-\\nease is also known as thromboangitis obliterans.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of Buerger’s disease is not known. It\\nis seen most often in young to middle-aged men (ages20-40) who are heavy smokers of cigarettes. Cases ofthis disease in non-smokers are very rare, hence, ciga-rette smoking is considered a causative factor. Approxi-\\nmately 40% of the patients have a history of inflamma-tion of a vein (phlebitis), which may play a role in thedevelopment of Buerger’s disease. The disease is mainlyseen in the legs of affected persons, but may also appearin their arms. Early symptoms include decrease in theblood supply (arterial ischemia ) and superficial (near the\\nskin surface) phlebitis. The main symptom is pain in the\\naffected areas. Onset of the disease is gradual and firstoccurs in the feet or hands. Inflammation occurs in smalland medium-sized arteries and veins near the surface ofthe limb. In advanced cases, blood vessels in other partsof the body may be affected. There is a progressivedecrease in the blood flow to the affected areas. Thepulse in arteries of the feet is weak or undetectable. Thelack of blood flow can lead to gangrene, which is decayof tissue due to restricted blood supply. A cold sensitivityin the hands, similar to that seen in Raynaud’s disease ,\\ncan develop. In this case, the hands turn color—white,blue, and then red—when exposed to the cold.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is usually made from the clinical symp-\\ntoms. Patients frequently complain of numbness, tin-gling, or burning sensations in the affected area beforeevidence of vascular inflammation becomes apparent.KEY TERMS\\nGangrene —A decay of the tissue in a part of the\\nbody that experiences restricted blood flow.\\nInflammation —A local reaction to irritation, injury,\\nor infection characterized by pain, swelling, red-ness, and occasional loss of function.\\nIschemia —A decrease in the blood supply to an\\narea of the body caused by obstruction or con-striction of blood vessels.\\nPhlebitis —Inflammation of a vein.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no effective medication or surgery for this\\ndisease. Patients must stop smoking to halt further devel-opment of the symptoms. Vasodilators , drugs that\\nincrease the diameter of the blood vessels, can be admin-istered, but may not be effective. Exposure of affectedareas to heat or cold should be avoided. Trauma to thefeet and other affected areas should be avoided and infec-tions must be treated promptly.\\nPrognosis\\nThe disease is progressive in patients who do not\\nstop smoking. Areas with gangrene must be removed sur-gically.\\nPrevention\\nSmoking is the only known causative agent for this\\ndisease and should be avoided.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBerkow, R., ed.

People with bulimia, known as bulimics, consume\\nlarge amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid them-selves of the food and calories (purge) by fasting , exces-\\nsive exercise , vomiting, or using laxatives . The behavior\\noften serves to reduce stress and relieve anxiety . Because\\nbulimia results from an excessive concern with weightcontrol and self-image, and is often accompanied bydepression, it is also considered a psychiatric illness.\\nDescription\\nBulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for over\\ntwo million adolescent girls and young women in theUnited States. The bingeing and purging activity associ-ated with this disorder can cause severe damage, evendeath , although the risk of death is not as high as for\\nanorexia nervosa , an eating disorder that leads to exces-\\nsive weight loss.\\nBinge eating may in rare instances cause the stom-\\nach to rupture. In the case of purging, heart failure can\\nresult due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium.\\nV omiting causes other serious problems, including acid-related scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit-ing) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tubethat brings food from the mouth to the stomach (theesophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glandscan become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can alsoresult, and interest in sex may diminish.\\nMost bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior\\nwithout professional help. Many typically recognize thatthe behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Somebulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviorssuch as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer fromother psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression,anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\\nMost bulimics are females in their teens or early 20s.\\nMales account for only 5-10% of all cases. People of allraces develop the disorder, but most of those diagnosedare white.\\nBulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy,\\naccompanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly,many people with bulimia appear healthy and successful,while inside they have feelings of helplessness and lowself-esteem.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchers\\nbelieve that it may be caused by a combination of geneticand environmental factors. Bulimia tends to run in fami-lies. Research shows that certain brain chemicals, knownas neurotransmitters, may function abnormally in acutelyill bulimia patients. Scientists also believe there may be a\\nlink between bulimia and other psychiatric problems,such as depression and OCD. Environmental influencesinclude participation in work or sports that emphasizethinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam-ily pressures also may play a role. One study found thatmothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh-ters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to causebulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend tohave fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.\\nSymptoms\\nAccording to the American Anorexia/Bulimia Asso-\\nciation, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:\\n• eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)\\n• vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics , or engaging in\\nfasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)\\n• preoccupation with body weight• using the bathroom frequently after meals• depression or mood swings• irregular menstrual periods\\n• onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,\\nheartburn or bloating\\nDiagnosis\\nBulimia is treated most successfully when diag-\\nnosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is aproblem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com-plete physical examination in order to rule out other ill-\\nnesses is the first step to diagnosis.\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association,\\na diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all ofthe following symptoms:\\n• recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average\\nof two binge-eating episodes a week for at least threemonths)\\n• a feeling of lack of control over eating during the\\nbinges\\n• regular use of one or more of the following to prevent\\nweight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives ordiuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise\\n• persistent over-concern with body shape and weight\\nTreatment\\nEarly treatment is important otherwise bulimia may\\nbecome chronic, with serious health consequences.

The rightbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theright ventricle (the lower chamber of the heart) and the leftbundle carries nerve impulses that cause contraction of theleft ventricle. The two bundles initially are together at ajunction called the bundle of His. Nerve impulses comethrough the sinus node of the heart to the bundle of Hisand then move into the right and left bundle branches.Bundle branch block is a slowing or interruption of nerveimpulses. A problem may exist in any of the three bundles.\\nPatients with BBB are generally without symptoms\\nunless the disease is severe enough to cause a completeinfranodal A-V block and very slow heart rate. In patientswith right bundle branch block (RBBB), the nerve impulseis conducted slowly or not at all. The right ventricle finallyreceives the impulse through muscle-to-muscle spread,outside the regular nerve pathway. This mechanism ofimpulse transmission is slow and results in a delayed con-traction of the right ventricle. There are several types ofleft bundle branch block (LBBB), each producing its owncharacteristic mechanism of failure. In each case, thenerve impulse is blocked or delayed. Patients with LBBBmay have left ventricular disease or cardiomyopathy.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nLeft bundle branch block usually happens as a con-\\nsequence of other diseases such as arteriosclerosis,rheumatic fever ,congenital heart disease ,myocardi-\\ntis, myocardial infarction, metastatic heart tumors, or\\nother invasions of the heart tissue. Right bundle branchblock happens less often from underlying heart disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nDetection of BBB usually takes place during a nor-\\nmal physical examination .

This foot bone is displaced in the direction ofthe four other metatarsals connected with the toes. Theother bone involved is the big toe itself, which is dis-placed toward the smaller toes. As the big toe continuesto move toward the smaller toes, it may become dis-placed under or over the second toe. The displacement ofthese two foot bones causes a projection of bone on theinside portion of the forefoot. The skin over this projec-tion often becomes inflamed from rubbing against theshoe, and a callus may form.\\nThe joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled with\\nfluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to movesmoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac becomesinflamed and thickened. The swelling in the joint causesadditional pain and pressure in the toe.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of\\nthe foot during walking or running. One common exam-ple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount ofstress placed upon the inside of the foot. This leads to\\nfriction and irritation of the involved structures. Age hasalso been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in partbecause the underlying bone displacement worsens overtime unless corrective measures are taken.\\nWearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those\\nwith a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, oftencauses the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformityis seen more often in women than men. The higher fre-quency in females may be related to the strong linkbetween footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in arecent survey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% woreshoes that were at least one size too small or too narrow.\\nBecause genetic factors can predispose people to the\\nhallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family historyof bunions can increase the likelihood of developing thisfoot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and severalgenetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn-\\ndrome and Marfan syndrome , cause muscle imbal-\\nances that can create bunions from displacement of thefirst metatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes ofbunions are leg-length discrepancies, with the bunionpresent on the longer leg, and trauma occurring to thejoint of the big toe.\\nSymptoms of bunions include the common signs of\\ninflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. Thediscomfort is primarily located along the inside of thefoot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callusmay develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of thetoes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs.Inflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion\\nwith associated discomfort in the joint between the bigtoe and the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skinover the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, whichalso presents a problem of potential infection. (Footulcers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia-betes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer formingand healing if it becomes infected.)\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\\nphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis ofbunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con-firm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement,joint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth ofbone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con-sider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by orcomplicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of thecartilage of the joint), gout (which causes the accumula-\\ntion of uric acid crystals in the joint), tiny fractures of a\\nbone in the foot (stress fractures), or infection and mayorder additional tests to rule out these possibilities.\\nTreatment\\nConservative\\nThe first step in treating a bunion is to remove as\\nmuch pressure from the area as possible. People withbunions should wear shoes that have enough room in thetoe box to accommodate the bunion and avoid high-heeledshoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings. Dressings andpads help protect the bunion from additional shoe pres-sure. The application of splints or customized shoe inserts(orthotics) to correct the alignment of the big toe joint iseffective for many bunions.

In some cases,physicians also use steroid injections with local anestheticaround the bunion to reduce inflammation.\\nSurgery\\nIf conservative treatment is not successful, surgical\\nremoval of the bunion may be necessary to correct thedeformity. This procedure is called a bunionectomy, andthere are many variations on the operation, which is usu-ally performed by a surgeon who specializes in treatingbone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who specializesin treating the foot (podiatry). Surgeons consider theangle of the bone misalignment, the condition of thebursa, and the strength of the bones when they choosewhich procedure to use. Most bunionectomies involvethe removal of a section of bone and the insertion of pinsto rejoin the bone. Sometimes the surgeons may moveligaments (which connect bone to bone in the joint) ortendons (which connect bone to muscle) in order torealign the bones. After this procedure, the bones andother tissues are held in place while they heal by com-pression dressings or a short cast. The individual mustrefrain from vigorous exercise for six weeks.\\nAlternative treatment\\nDeep friction massage techniques by a physical or\\nmassage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation,reduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue build up.Physical therapy also provides useful approaches such asultrasound to help retard or reverse the formation of thebunion. Various taping techniques can be useful torealign the toe and decrease friction and rubbing thatmay be present.

A second-degree burn involves redness, swellingand blistering, and the damage may extend beneath theepidermis to deeper layers of skin (dermis). A third-degree burn, also called a full-thickness burn, destroys theentire depth of skin, causing significant scarring. Damagealso may extend to the underlying fat, muscle, or bone.\\nThe severity of the burn is also judged by the\\namount of body surface area (BSA) involved. Health careworkers use the “rule of nines” to determine the percent-age of BSA affected in patients more than 9 years old:each arm with its hand is 9% of BSA; each leg with itsfoot is 18%; the front of the torso is 18%; the back of thetorso, including the buttocks, is 18%; the head and neckare 9%; and the genital area (perineum) is 1%. This rulecannot be applied to a young child’s body proportions, soBSA is estimated using the palm of the patient’s hand asa measure of 1% area.\\nThe severity of the burn will determine not only the\\ntype of treatment, but also where the burn patient shouldreceive treatment. Minor burns may be treated at home orin a doctor’s office. These are defined as first- or second-degree burns covering less than 15% of an adult’s bodyor less than 10% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burnon less than 2% BSA. Moderate burns should be treated\\nat a hospital. These are defined as first- or second-degreeburns covering 15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-20%of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10%BSA. Critical, or major, burns are the most serious andshould be treated in a specialized burn unit of a hospital.These are defined as first- or second-degree burns cover-ing more than 25% of an adult’s body or more than 20%of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on more than10% BSA. In addition, burns involving the hands, feet,face, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical. Otherfactors influence the level of treatment needed, includingassociated injuries such as bone fractures and smoke\\ninhalation , presence of a chronic disease, or a history of\\nbeing abused. Also, children and the elderly are morevulnerable to complications from burn injuries andrequire more intensive care.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nBurns may be caused by even a brief encounter with\\nheat greater than 120°F (49°C).

Extensive burns may\\ninduce shock , the symptoms of which are faintness,\\nweakness, rapid pulse and breathing, pale and clammyskin, and bluish lips and fingernails.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physician will diagnose a burn based upon visual\\nexamination, and will also ask the patient or family mem-bers questions to determine the best treatment. He or shemay also check for smoke inhalation, carbon monoxide\\npoisoning , cyanide poisoning , other event-related trau-\\nma, or, if suspected, further evidence of child abuse .\\nTreatment\\nBurn treatment consists of relieving pain, preventing\\ninfection, and maintaining body fluids, electrolytes, andcalorie intake while the body heals. Treatment of chemi-cal or electrical burns is slightly different from the treat-ment of thermal burns but the objectives are the same.\\nThermal burn treatment\\nThe first act of thermal burn treatment is to stop the\\nburning process. This may be accomplished by letting coolwater run over the burned area or by soaking it in cool (notcold) water. Ice should never be applied to the burn. Cool(not cold) wet compresses may provide some pain reliefwhen applied to small areas of first- and second-degreeburns. Butter, shortening, or similar salve should never beapplied to the burn since it prevents heat from escapingand drives the burning process deeper into the skin.\\nIf the burn is minor, it may be cleaned gently with\\nsoap and water. Blisters should not be broken. If the skinof the burned area is unbroken and it is not likely to befurther irritated by pressure or friction, the burn shouldbe left exposed to the air to promote healing. If the skinis broken or apt to be disturbed, the burned area shouldbe coated lightly with an antibacterial ointment and cov-ered with a sterile bandage. Aspirin ,acetaminophen\\n(Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) may be taken to ease painand relieve inflammation. A doctor should be consulted\\nif these signs of infection appear: increased warmth, red-ness, pain, or swelling; pus or similar drainage from thewound; swollen lymph nodes; or red streaks spreadingaway from the burn.\\nIn situations where a person has received moderate or\\ncritical burns, lifesaving measures take precedence overburn treatment and emergency medical assistance must becalled. A person with serious burns may stop breathing,and artificial respiration (also called mouth-to-mouthresuscitation or rescue breathing) should be administeredimmediately. Also, a person with burns covering morethan 12% BSA is likely to go into shock; this conditionmay be prevented by laying the person flat and elevatingthe feet about 12 in (30 cm). Burned arms and handsshould also be raised higher than the person’s heart.\\nIn rescues, a blanket may be used to smother any\\nflames as the person is removed from danger. The personwhose clothing is on fire should “stop, drop, and roll” orbe assisted in lying flat on the ground and rolling to putout the fire. Afterwards, only burnt clothing that comesoff easily should be removed; any clothing embedded inthe burn should not be disturbed. Removing any smol-dering apparel and covering the person with a light, cool,wet cloth, such as a sheet but not a blanket or towel, willstop the burning process.\\nAt the hospital, the staff will provide further med-\\nical treatment. A tube to aid breathing may be inserted ifthe patient’s airways or lungs have been damaged, ascan happen during an explosion or a fire in a enclosedspace. Also, because burns dramatically deplete thebody of fluids, replacement fluids are administeredintravenously. The patient is also given antibiotics intra-\\nvenously to prevent infection, and he or she may alsoreceive a tetanus shot, depending on his or her immu-\\nnization history. Once the burned area is cleaned andtreated with antibiotic cream or ointment, it is coveredin sterile bandages, which are changed two to threetimes a day. Surgical removal of dead tissue ( debride-\\nment ) also takes place. As the burns heal, thick, taut\\nscabs (eschar) form, which the doctor may have to cut toimprove blood flow to the more elastic healthy tissuebeneath. The patient will also undergo physical and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 618BurnsClassification Of Burns\\nFirst-Degree (Minor) The burned area is painful. The outer skin is reddened.

Askin graft involves taking a piece of skin from anunburned portion of the patient’s body (autograft) andtransplanting it to the burned area. When doctors cannotimmediately use the patient’s own skin, a temporary graftis performed using the skin of a human donor (allograft),either alive or dead, or the skin of an animal (xenograft),usually that of a pig.\\nThe burn victim also may be placed in a hyperbaric\\nchamber, if one is available. In a hyperbaric chamber(which can be a specialized room or enclosed space), thepatient is exposed to pure oxygen under high pressure,which can aid in healing. However, for this therapy to beeffective, the patient must be placed in a chamber within24 hours of being burned.\\nChemical burn treatment\\nBurns from liquid chemicals must be rinsed with\\ncool water for at least 15 minutes to stop the burningprocess. Any burn to the eye must be similarly flushedwith water. In cases of burns from dry chemicals such aslime, the powder should be completely brushed awaybefore the area is washed. Any clothing which may haveabsorbed the chemical should be removed. The burnshould then be loosely covered with a sterile gauze padand the person taken to the hospital for further treatment.A physician may be able to neutralize the offendingchemical with another before treating the burn like athermal burn of similar severity.\\nElectrical burn treatment\\nBefore electrical burns are treated at the site of the\\naccident, the power source must be disconnected if possi-ble and the victim moved away from it to keep the persongiving aid from being electrocuted.

Bursaecushion the movement between the bones, tendons andmuscles near the joints. Bursitis is most often caused byrepetitive movement and is known by several commonnames including weaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, andminer’s elbow, depending on the affected individual’soccupation and area of injury.Description\\nThere are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual-\\nly bursae are present from birth, but they may form inresponse to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a smallamount of synovial fluid, a clear liquid that acts as a\\nlubricant. Inflammation causes pain on movement. The\\nmost common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder(subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecranon),hips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes. Theaffected area may be referred to as “frozen,” becausemovement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae,and all can become inflamed with overuse.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe most common cause of bursitis is repeated\\nphysical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason.It can also be caused by trauma, rheumatoid arthritis ,\\ngout , and acute or chronic infection.\\nPain and tenderness are common symptoms. If the\\naffected joint is close to the skin, as with the shoulder,knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and redness areseen and the area may feel warm to the touch. The bursaearound the hip joint are deeper, and swelling is not obvi-ous. Movement may be limited and is painful. In theshoulder, it may be difficult to raise the arm out from theside of the body. Putting on a jacket or combing the hairbecomes a troublesome activity.\\nIn acute bursitis symptoms appear suddenly; with\\nchronic bursitis, pain, tenderness, and limited movementreappear after exercise or strain.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen a patient has pain in a joint, a careful physical\\nexamination is needed to determine what type of move-\\nment is affected and if there is any swelling present. Bur-sitis will not show up on x-rays, although sometimesthere are also calcium deposits in the joint that can beseen. Inserting a thin needle into the affected bursa andremoving (aspirating) some of the synovial fluid forexamination can confirm the diagnosis. In most cases,the fluid will not be clear. It can be tested for the pres-ence of microorganisms, which would indicate an infec-tion, and crystals, which could indicate gout. In instanceswhere the diagnosis is difficult, a local anesthetic (a drugthat numbs the area) is injected into the painful spot. Ifthe discomfort stops temporarily, then bursitis is proba-bly the correct diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nConservative treatment of bursitis is usually effec-\\ntive.

A sling can be used\\nfor a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip problems.The patient can take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin , ibuprofin, and naproxen.\\nThey can be obtained without a prescription and relievethe pain and inflammation. Once the pain decreases,exercises of the affected area can begin. If the nearbymuscles have become weak because of the disease orprolonged immobility, then exercises to build strengthand improve movement are best. A doctor or physicaltherapist can prescribe an effective regimen.\\nIf the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condition\\nlike arthritis or gout, then management of that disease isneeded to control the bursitis.\\nWhen bursitis does not respond to conservative\\ntreatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor-ticosteroid preparation, like prednisone, can bring imme-diate and lasting relief. A corticosteroid is a hormonalsubstance that is the most effective drug for reducinginflammation. The drug is mixed with a local anestheticand works on the joint within five minutes. Usually oneinjection is all that is needed.\\nSurgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per-\\nformed in extreme cases.\\nIf the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi-\\ntional treatment is needed. Septic bursitis is caused by the\\npresence of a pus-forming organism, usually staphylococ-\\ncus aureus. This is confirmed by examining a sample of\\nthe fluid in the bursa and requires treatment with antibi-\\notics taken by mouth, injected into a muscle or into a vein\\n(intravenously). The bursa will also need to be drained byneedle two or three times over the first week of treatment.When a patient has such a serious infection, there may beunderlying causes. There could be undiscovered diabetes,or an inefficient immune system caused by humanimmunodeficiency virus infection (HIV).\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative treatments take into consideration the\\nrole of diet in causing bursitis. The faulty use of calciumby the body, magnesium deficiency, and food allergies\\nmay have a role. Diet changes and vitamin supplementsmay be helpful. The use of herbs, homeopathy ,aro-\\nmatherapy , and hydrotherapy can help relieve symp-\\ntoms. Ginger is useful in reducing inflammation.Acupuncture has been proven effective in treating hip\\nand shoulder pain caused by bursitis and other condi-tions. Other therapies that deal effectively with muscu-loskeletal problems (relating to the muscles and skele-ton), may also be helpful, such as body work, magnetic\\nfield therapy ,naturopathic medicine ,chiropractic ,\\nand applied kinesiology .KEY TERMS\\nArthritis —Inflammation of a joint that may lead to\\nchanges in the joint’s structure.

Overexercising or the repetition of a movementthat triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing exer-cises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will alsohelp. When doing repetitive tasks, frequent breaks shouldbe taken and the activity should be alternated with othersusing different parts of the body. To cushion the joints, itis a good idea to use cushioned chairs when sitting andfoam kneeling pads for the knees. Leaning on the elbows,kneeling or sitting on a hard surface for a long period oftime should be avoided.

Also called brown lung disease, byssinosis resultsfrom inhaling particles of cotton, flax, hemp, or jute.\\nDescription\\nAlthough inhaling cotton dust was identified as a\\nsource of respiratory disease more than 300 years ago,byssinosis has been recognized as an occupational haz-ard for textile workers for less than 50 years. More than800,000 workers in the cotton, flax, and rope-makingindustries are exposed in the workplace to airborne parti-cles that can cause byssinosis. Only workers in mills thatmanufacture yarn, thread, or fabric have a significant riskof dying of this disease.\\nIn the United States, byssinosis is almost completely\\nlimited to workers who handle unprocessed cotton. Morethan 35,000 textile workers have been disabled by byssi-nosis and 183 died between 1979 and 1992. Most of thepeople whose deaths were due to byssinosis lived in thetextile-producing regions of North and South Carolina.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nWheezing ,shortness of breath , and a feeling of\\ntightness in the chest occur occasionally during the earlystages of the disease. Symptoms are usually more pro-nounced when returning to work after a weekend, holi-day, or vacation and subside as the worker becomes reac-customed to the environment.\\nAs many as 25% of workers with byssinosis have\\nsymptoms that continue or recur throughout the work-week. More severe breathing problems seem to resultboth from exposure to high levels of dust and fromlonger dust exposure. Workers who also smoke cigarettessuffer the most severe impairment.Diagnosis\\nTests that detect decreasing lung capacity during the\\nworkday are used to diagnose byssinosis. Obstructivepatterns are likely in patients who have had recurrentsymptoms for more than 10 years.\\nTreatment\\nTherapy for early-stage byssinosis focuses on\\nreversing airway narrowing. Antihistamines may be pre-\\nscribed to reduce tightness in the chest. Bronchodilators\\n(drugs used to relax breathing passages and improve airflow) may be used with an inhaler or taken in tablet form.Reducing exposure is essential. Any worker who hassymptoms of byssinosis or who has trouble breathingshould transfer to a less-contaminated area.\\nPrognosis\\nSmoking , impaired lung function, and a history of\\nrespiratory allergy increase a textile worker’s risk of devel-oping byssinosis. Prolonged exposure makes patientswheeze more often and can cause chronic bronchitis . It\\ndoes not lead to permanently disabling lung disease.\\nPrevention\\nEliminating exposure to textile dust is the surest way\\nto prevent byssinosis. Using exhaust hoods, improvingventilation, and employing wetting procedures are verysuccessful methods of controlling dust levels to preventbyssinosis. Protective equipment required during certainprocedures also prevents exposure to levels of contami-nation that exceed the current United States standard forcotton dust exposure.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHarrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine.
