# Healthy Lifestyle Classification

This project uses the [Healthy Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditibabu/healthy-lifestyle) to classify individuals as **healthy** or **unhealthy** based on their lifestyle habits.  
We build an **ML pipeline** that includes preprocessing, data balancing, and model selection with **cross-validation**.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source:** [Healthy Lifestyle Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditibabu/healthy-lifestyle)
- **Description:** Contains lifestyle-related features such as:
  - Physical Activity
  - Sleep Patterns
  - Diet Habits
  - Stress Levels
  - Smoking & Alcohol Consumption  
  along with a target variable indicating health status.
- **Task:** Binary classification — `Healthy` vs `Unhealthy`.

## ⚙️ Features of the Project

1. **Pipeline with Imbalanced Learning**
   - Used `imblearn.Pipeline` to chain together transformations, balancing, and classification.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Applied transformations (`TF`) for handling categorical and numerical data.
3. **Class Balancing**
   - Used `SMOTE` or similar balancing technique to handle class imbalance.
4. **Model Selection**
   - Compared:
     - `RandomForestClassifier`
     - `AdaBoostClassifier`
     - `XGBClassifier`
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Implemented `GridSearchCV` with multiple parameter grids.
6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Performed **5-Fold Cross-Validation** for reliable performance estimation.
   - Calculated mean accuracy across folds.
7. **Final Prediction**
   - Trained the best model on the full training data and generated predictions on `X_test`.
