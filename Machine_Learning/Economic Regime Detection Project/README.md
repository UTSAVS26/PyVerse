## 📘 Introduction
This initiative aims to detect and categorize various market conditions by utilizing historical stock price data. Through the use of sophisticated analytical techniques, the project offers valuable insights into market dynamics, providing essential information for traders and investors.

## 💼 Challenge Overview
Accurate identification of market trends is critical for formulating sound investment strategies. Traditional methodologies often fail to adapt to the complex and evolving nature of financial markets, resulting in unreliable outcomes. This project intends to develop a more adaptive and precise detection model for enhanced market insights.

## 💡 Solution Approach
The project implements time series analysis alongside clustering methodologies to categorize market states using historical price data.

### Core Components

| Component                | Details                                                          |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Gathering**       | Collects stock price data through Yahoo Finance API.            |
| **Data Processing**      | Calculates daily returns, volatility, and moving averages.      |
| **Feature Creation**     | Develops specialized features for clustering purposes.           |
| **Clustering Technique** | Uses K-Means algorithm to differentiate market phases.           |
| **Regime Analysis**      | Assesses and labels identified market conditions.                |
| **Model Backtesting**    | Tests the model’s accuracy by reviewing historical performance.  |

## 🛠 Setup & Implementation
To prepare the environment, ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed:

| Library           | Functionality                                    |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `pandas`          | Data management and transformation.             |
| `numpy`           | Numerical computations and operations.          |
| `matplotlib`      | Visualization of patterns and trends.           |
| `scikit-learn`    | Machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.|
| `yfinance`        | Fetches historical stock market data.           |

Install these libraries by running:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn yfinance
```
## 🔧 Explored Alternatives
The project assessed several different approaches for market phase detection:

| Alternative Method          | Description                                                                  |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Conventional ML Models** | Approaches like SVM and k-NN; while effective, they tend to be less flexible.|
| **Time Series Approaches** | Methods such as ARIMA and GARCH; good for forecasting, but not ideal for classifying market regimes. |

## 📊 Findings
The model successfully detects various economic conditions such as Bull, Bear, and Neutral markets with high accuracy, providing traders with valuable insights to adjust their strategies accordingly.

## 🔍 Summary
This project underscores the importance of identifying market regimes within the financial industry. By leveraging data-driven techniques, it supports informed decision-making and strategy development for investments.
