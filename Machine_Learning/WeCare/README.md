# **PROJECT TITLE: Medicine Prediction System**

### 🎯 **Goal**

The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases based on input symptoms. The purpose is to enhance the decision-making process in healthcare by providing a reliable tool for symptom-based disease prediction.

### 🧵 **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project can be found [here](datasets\Training.csv). It is sourced from [source name], which contains relevant medical records and symptom-disease relationships.

### 🧾 **Description**

This project involves creating a web application that allows users to input symptoms and receive predicted diseases. It incorporates a user-friendly interface and robust backend logic to process data efficiently.

### 🧮 **What I had done!**

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset of symptoms and diseases.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for model training, including handling missing values and normalizing data.
3. **Model Selection**: Chose appropriate machine learning algorithms for disease prediction.
4. **Model Training**: Trained the selected models on the preprocessed dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using accuracy metrics and validation techniques.
6. **Deployment**: Developed a Flask web application to serve the prediction model.

### 🚀 **Models Implemented**

- **Logistic Regression**: Chosen for its simplicity and interpretability.
- **Decision Tree**: Selected for its ability to handle non-linear data.
- **Random Forest**: Used for its robustness and high accuracy in classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine**: Implemented for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.

### 📚 **Libraries Needed**

- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn


### 📈 **Performance of the Models based on the Accuracy Scores**

- **Logistic Regression**: 85%
- **Decision Tree**: 80%
- **Random Forest**: 90%
