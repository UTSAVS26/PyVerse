# PROJECT TITLE: Movie Classification Model

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal of this project is to develop a model that extracts major topics from a large amount of reviews.
## 🧵 Dataset

The dataset used for this project has been scraped from CollegeDunia.com, specifically the Movies Dataset. The dataset contains the following attributes:
    1. Name of the user who wrote the review (Name)
    2. College name (college)
    3. review
    4. rating

## 🧾 Description

This project involves building a machine learning model to identify major topics in college reviews. The model is trained on a dataset of reviews which has been scraped from CollegeDunia.com.

## 🚀 Models Implemented

    Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model: LDA is a Bayesian network that analyzes documents to determine the topics they belong to. It does this by assigning each word in a document to different topics, and then mapping the document to a list of topics. 


## 📢 Conclusion

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model provided the major topics of discussion in user reviews.
