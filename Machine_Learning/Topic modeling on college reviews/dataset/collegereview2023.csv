College is as much a space to study but is also a hub of networking with people who even 5 or 6 years down the lane would help you out giving a push to your career in the right direction.
Plus for many students who can't afford it right away, the college has provisions for many scholarships and schemes for relaxation and easy loan lending which is a great boon.Curriculum and Faculty here are a hit or miss. Some are way too good with students, others might have their walls up and be strict to the teeth with their methodology and teaching.

Only a few of the faculty are good most of them don't interact with students and have such weird attitudes toward the students. Most of the faculty are master's or Ph.D. graduate but few of them teach well not all some teacher is friends with the student want but they are few in number.
 The student ratio is not soo good as the girls-to-boys ratio in engineering sucks so but in our branch, it is good than most of the branches in our college.
Exams are conducted timely after 3 months there is mid sem and again after 3 months there is an end-semester exam the difficulty of the exam is moderate most of the questions are asked from class notes/lectures.Fees structure for btech is around 1.5lakh and if you are from sc/ st or you have a family income less than 1 lakh so your total fees will be around 15-20k something as you may get full fees remission on tuition fees  and as I belong to sc so it is affordable for me but I live outside pg so it cost around 1 lakh yearly so that not a good thing I cannot afford that much so we have taken a loan 
And most of the students don't get a hostel here as there are not sufficient hostels so they live in pgs.
The hostel fees are around 45k yearly.
And if you don't get a hostel so for a good pg its rent is around 3000 per month so around 36,000 yearly + mess charges will be also 36000 yearly so around 72000.

213,Priyanshu Raj,National Institute of Technology - [NIT],"Fees are high to be honest, in a government college, we think to get world-class facilities at low fees but fees are high, but you have no need to worry, SBI gives special loans to nit students with a low rate of interest and some state governments also give loans to poor students.
Fees hike policy is not good for us general middle-class students as we have to struggle to make ends meet and then we also got to have laptops and all which will cost you at least 40-50 thousand if you want to do Photoshop and editing on it but fee remission is there to protect us if your family income is less than 5 lakh rupees, you can avail the fee remission and if you belong to Scheduled castes or Scheduled tribes, you don't have to worry about fees, you are fully remitted of tuition fees. 
I personally belong to the general category and most of the scholarships are either given to the reserved category students or to the girl students so I personally feel bad due to the fee hike policy of the government.Our college is having many many fests like the annual fest named culfest and branch fets like technica, we have fests in 1-2 months regularly,  our campus life is pretty chill, with the availability of ready-to-eat shops and nice sports facilities like volleyball, badminton, lawn tennis, table tennis, cricket, hockey, Javelin throw, chess, etc. You will never get bored here.

And the facilities that you can redeem with that much amount are Null.
Plus if you are going for the hostel you have to pay an extra of 1.02 per year which includes mess and non-ac rooms. And for ac room, you have to pay 1.32 lakh per year. And with all that money you will get just nothing. And if I talk about the infrastructure. Then, 
To be honest I don't like the infrastructure of this college. But if you are the one who takes the admission just by looking at the infrastructure of the college then you should go for ABES EC instead of ABESIT. Yes,  many students got confused between obesity and abesec as they look like one college if you see from a distance but the reality is they are not. And if you are thinking about taking the hostel then my friend please drop the idea for ABESIT hostel. You won't live in the hostel live here instead you will live the life of a prisoner.If you have a good understanding of power but are not a good learner you might have gone to ABESIT college. 
Here, the classes are big enough but it doesn't feel like you are in a technical University. It just feels like you are in a high-standard school classroom. Even their projectors won't work sometimes. If we talk about faculty members, some of them are so good at their work that it feels illegal for them to be par of such a college. If they would have tried they have got better opportunities in IITs and NITs. Some faculty members (especially if you are in the first year and of sec 8 ) will get a class mentor and he would be your maths prof also. Sometimes you guys also got confused that how he got this job.
The ratio of prof to students is 1:60 approx. (this ratio changes as you go for different branches of b.tech.

Also, self development is always the only thing.Pretty good companies visit the college, not the tech giants though. If you're okay with TATA and Infosys and all, that's upto you.

The faculty of Chandigarh University encourages both studies and extra-curricular activities, which go hand-in-hand towards getting top placement offers, because the companied demand not only the theoretical knowledge, but also other skills, which students can learn through participation in extra-curriculars. A lot of teaching, a little bit of research, hands-on experiences and lots of extra-curriculars to help you develop as an all-rounder.

Their advertisements regarding a conducive international environment is misleading at best, because of the xenophobic (more so racial) attitude that its inhabitants promote. Do not believe in any of their advertisements as they resort to boast irrationally to capitalize on its students’ misfortune. Some other important points Its not in Chandigarh!

Most of the students do internships in reputed companies during summer break of third year.The best part of IIT Delhi is its campus life. The campus of IIT Delhi is very beautiful and every student enjoys his campus life. However the gender ratio is quite low, for every one girl their are five boys which is disappointing. Every student is engaged with a lot of extracurricular activities including sports, drama, dance, fine arts, debating,etc. IIT Delhi has facilities for almost every sports.

1095,Student (Anonymous),Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology - [Thapar University],Thapar is a well known private college and one of the best private engineering college in north india. It has a good NIRF ranking. The best thing about thapar is the liberty it offers the students to explore various fields other than academics. It has well established societies in every field that have their own culture and function in their own manner. I opted for this course because of personal interest mainly.I am a first year student. So cannot say much about the placements and job opportunities. From what i have heard the placements are fine.

The faculty members only prefer or recommend basic books, which are sufficient but not fully equipped with what you want. The hostels are the worst. Please don't prefer hostels.Some of the faculty members here are really helpful, and some are not from the computer science department. Some of the teachers are highly qualified but even if they are qualified they lack in English language in which most of the outside students face a severe problem, but some faculty are really knowledgeable.

The best part of the course is you will get a degree and nothing else like skills. You have to work hard on your own. Courses should be updated, and subjects like physics, chemistry, mechanics, electrical and electronics are of no use to a computer engineer. Subjects which are taught later should be included earlier so that students will get enough time to prepare themselves for the placement drives. University should provide extra encouragement for activities like fests, college events, etc. Academically good students should be provided with scholarships, and the campus should be checked for hygiene standards.Facilities provided here are average, and the infrastructure is good in comparison to other colleges. Wi-Fi is provided, but it is not used by the students regularly. The library has good books. Classrooms are average, and there is no air-conditioner. Laboratories have air-conditioners.

Our curriculum also gives a fair chance to everyone irrespective of any objection. We get regular Assignments, homeworks to revise the taught topics. Also we have regular class test organised. The courses are very much industry Specific so we have a good time understanding the machines. Also we have Workshops which teach us to use commom machines and things like welding, grinding, Lathe machine, Drilling etc. I applied for CEE entrance examination and got a respectable rank which allowed me to get a seat in this prestigious college of Assam. We were called for counseling round where we had chosen our desired branch. It was 1st organised at AIE, Guwahati where we finalised our College and Branch.

1282,Ainesh Sannidhi,International Institute of Information Technology - [IIIT],"Most of the faculty are heavily involved with research aspects of their field of study. Hence they do have a good expertise of their fields. For our course we have had around 6 professors for each semester. Their average age I would say is around 45-50. They are all extremely qualified with many of them holding a doctorate or post doctorate at globally renowned institutes. Most professors are helpful and do provide good clarity for doubts but some are a bit headstrong and get annoyed by ‘silly doubts’. Many of the lecturers have a good amount of industry experience and do tell us about their experience and how certain things that we have been taught are useful and applied in the real world. I have learnt a lot of skills which I believe are necessary for computer science graduates and will be important to both get a job and work in the industry, such as via learning different programming languages. Various professors did expand on the industry application of the subject. As far placements are concerned our data structures and algorithms course will be very helpful for that. So far we haven’t had any industrial visits but I have interacted with both alumni and other people working at various organizations via events conducted by our college. ",8.0

1293,Soumyadip Mondal,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"A lot of alumni networks are almost as old as their alma maters. At the start, most of these associations were entirely voluntary, supported solely by individual alumni. Volunteers maintained mailing lists, collected dues to support activities, produced publications, organized events, and annual meetings. The world of Alumni Relations has come a long way since its inception in the early eighteenth-century. They became a vital part of most of the educational institutions now thanks to the efforts of many outstanding professionals in Alumni Relations.   A good alumni network benefits the institution, current students, and as well as its Alumni. It is a win-win situation for everyone.  I would like to conclude by saying that they are genuinely very helpful.Maintaining a positive relationship among students, teachers and the administrators creates a harmonious learning environment. When students are nurtured in such surroundings, they are likely to increase their intellectual accomplishments and learn more effectively.  Cooperative engagement: Encourage cooperation and mutual support by getting learners to study collaboratively. When learners study in a group, they share their ideas and knowledge to complete an assignment. Support from the peer group also helps to boost learners’ confidence. Unlike learning in isolation where discouragement or a sense of hopelessness may set in, learning becomes more enjoyable when friends are able to help or motivate one another.",10.0

1664,Abhishek Kumar,Gaya College of Engineering,"Many people believe that they, but that's not true. There actually are simple steps to dramatically reduce online tracking. Step 1. Download DuckDuckGo on all your devices
With just one download you'll get tracker blocking, private searching, increased encrypting, and privacy grading on all of your browsing. Our mobile app for / (DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser) and browser extensions for, and (DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials) has all of this in one seamless package. Step 2. Update your software
Your device operating systems get out-of-date over time, and old software can contain security bugs or settings that leak personal data. Set your devices (and the apps on them) them to update automatically. That way you'll always have the latest, safest versions. Step 3. Update your privacy settings
Make sure your devices are using the best privacy settings. Especially make sure you adjust per-app location settings, so that your location history isn’t leaking where it shouldn’t. For extra bonus points, review the apps you have installed. If there are any you haven't used for a while, remove them to reduce the chance of your personal data being shared in the background. Step 4. Use a password manager
Privacy and security are, but if your accounts are not secured, your privacy is at risk. Have you ever used the same password on more than one website? If the answer's yes, then your privacy may be. The fix is easy: start creating unique passwords for every website you use. That may sound like a lot of work, but it’s not when you use a password manager. Password managers generate and store secure passwords for you automatically. Many browsers now have them built-in, or you can use a tool like, or that work across multiple browsers. Step 5. Set up two-factor authentication
Two-factor authentication (also known as multi-step login) is where you use a code to log in to websites in addition to your password. You should set up two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible, and certainly on your major accounts (email, financial, etc. ). You can check if major sites have it available, which also links directly to the right documentation pages. And that’s it. Doing the above five steps makes a huge impact on your privacy online, from stopping Big Tech from sucking up all your browsing data to adding extra protection to your passwords and email. And, once set up, it doesn’t take much effort to maintain. So, let’s make 2020 the year we all take back our online privacy.

1696,Reeya Hazarika,NIT Silchar,"NITs are one of the most reputed colleges in India just behind IITs, some NITs even at par with IITs. Being an engineering aspirant and getting into this institute is almost a dream come true. The process of admission in quite simple - as it has been metioned. An entrance examination called the JEE Mains which tests our knowledge in PCM(Phy,Chem,Maths) is conducted for all of students at 10+2 level of the country (The foreign admission process is different and I don't have much idea about it). On the basis of our ranks (now, the rank was earlier given on the basis of marks but from last year onwards that is 2019 it is percentile based) we get into different NITs into different branches. CSE (Computer Science) being the most sought after branch is always filled in by the top rankers. On the basis of placements, infrastructure and other attributes all the NITs are ranked and some branches in some specific NITs are most sough after in India. (JEE Main score is also checked for some other colleges and there's a minimum percentile in JEE Main which is required to be qualified for appearing in JEE Advanced. The rank in JEE Adv is used for admission into IITs and some more colleges in India. JEE Adv is a must for all Indians and foreigners to get admitted into IIT). Having given all the general information, I will go specific for my college NIT Silchar or NITS. NITS offer 6 courses in BTech. It takes in 50% students from Home State and 50% from other states with horizontal reservation for different categories and within that another horizontal reservation for girls and PWD candidates. After the results of JEE Mains is out, we need to wait for the JoSsa online counseling that allocates seat on the basis of our ranks and our preferred choices taking into consideration all the reservations. It has 7 rounds of seat allocation (with 2 mock rounds) where our choice might improve in the further rounds. There's an entire process of float,slide and freeze. Anyways, after getting the 1st seat in any of the rounds, for instance I was allocated CSE in NITS in the 1st round itself we have to report physically at one of the listed reporting centers and float, slide or freeze our choice. In any case, if and when our final college is allocated at the end of the 7th round we have to physically take admission after paying the requisite fee for hostel and tuition thereby occupying our seat. The dates for allocation are around mid June and the admission dates for different colleges vary as for NITS, it lies in the end July. Last year it lasted from 19th july to 24th. The factors that made me choose this curriculum are the popularity of course, my ambition of following engineering, the placement scenario and the overall development of personality the collegee offers.There are various events being celebrated in our college. Almost everyday, there are different activities ranging from quizzes, jams, sports activities, literary activities, eco club activities, coding classes etc. going on (which naturally clash with each other all the time) but these aside there are 2 most grand events in the college, one being Tecnoesis, the techno-management fest and other the cultural fest, Incandescence. Generally the Tecnoesis is held at the year end in the odd semester and Incand in the even semester. There were some changes last year and both Tecno Incand were held at a closer interval. Tecnoesis has much activites to offer ranging from hackathons, coding contest participated by students from around the world; there are workshops; other robotic events; events under ASME and the guest lecture module. It finally ends with the Spark Night which can be said to be the closing ceremony. Tecnoesis being such hectic, Incandescence on the other hand is relaxing. All we have to do is sit back, relax and enjoy all the events going on. It is the grandest fest in the entire Northeastern India. Many celebrated guests, artists, rappers, metal bands, indie bands are a part of this event. It varies each year but Glitterati, Thundermarch and Carpe Diem are the most prominent events within Incandescence. It also offers prom nights for couples, is the stage for acoustic jam, voice of incand and many more. Apart from these, there is another event called Posua celebrated as a pre-Bihu event. It can be said to be the Spring fest of NIT Silchar. A one day full packed event showcasing talents from nooks and corners of Assam.",6.8

Lot many extracurricular activities (like debate competitions, poetry, skits, singing, dancing, instrument playing, spot painting, anchoring, rangoli making, origami, fashion shows, speech competition etc) are conducted every year in which students can participate according to their respective interests. Many competitions (like robotics, coding, instrumentations, model making, theme based innovations, etc) are conducted on basis of AICTE criteria. Gender ratio is almost 1:1 and there are no gender based or religion based discriminations. All are treated to be equal. Workshops consists of all well maintained machines as per university requirements. Parties like Fresher's Parties for FE students and Farewell Parties for BE students are arranged every year by SE & TE students respectively.Fee structure is absolutely feasible as compared to other colleges. The college provides transparency regarding fees and does not charge any extra fees out of university requirements. All modes of payments are accepted by the college. The annual fee is Rs. 86,565, but it depends upon which category the student belongs to. If a student is from Open Category she/he will have to pay full fees i.e Rs. 86,565. If the student belongs to OBC category then she/he requires to pay 49,000. Likewise the fee structure depends upon the category of the student. Additional fees like University Exam Fees Rs. 1000 is to be paid in each semester while filling the exam form.",9.5
1753,Ahmed Bilal Ziya,Anjuman-I-Islam's Kalsekar Technical Campus - [AIKTC],"As compared to other colleges in that locality our college have feasible rate for the fee. Fees -No fee structure is completely feasible because our college provides low cost studies to the students and you can also pay the fee in two instalments fee is not an issue with our college if someone was not able to pay fee due to some reasons or due to wealthy problem so scholarships are there for them you can.Bonhomie is the event of 4 to 5 days where all events like cultural, sports, technical takes place. Event Organisers are responsible for planning and co-ordinating events. Depending upon the company or organisation, the type and size of an event can vary dramatically. You may be involved with a large annual event such as, the Chelsea Flower Show or you may organise smaller events within a museum.",8.2
1754,Kartik kumar,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"The course curriculum is very good because if you got admission in vit in any branch, let's say chemical engineering then you don't have just to study chemical engineering core subject but you also have to study some cse course to such as python, object-oriented programming and Java etc. The laboratory is superb. Every faculty in our college is engaged in research. Lab faculty is chilled sometimes but at last you have to study to pass the FAT exam (Final Assessment Test).Some faculty is really good and ready to teach you anything. But some of them are not. Almost 90% of the faculty are Ph.D. holders from IIT or Isc Bangalore. they are good at research all of them are doing research in their own field. They are from various parts of the world. They will motivate us and they will encourage us to do research.",7.3

1756,Pranjal Raj,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"The Gender ratio here in VIT is very good as compared to different colleges. M:F ratio is around 4:1. There are students who come from all across the country and from abroad too. The student diversity is huge, they belong to different places and speak different languages. This college is very conservative college and is intolerant with regards to gender. The main gate in-time and hostel in-time for girls is earlier than that of boys. For the first 4 months after joining the college, the authorities don't allow the students to leave the college campus. If they want to leave for some reason they will have to take permission from their proctor, get him the affirmation of parents to approve the request and then get the permission from the warden of hostel. The college and hostel authorities are weird and strict. The college allow the girls to go out on weekends only for 4 hrs a day and that too with permission of the girls' warden/proctor. The entry and exit from the main gate is biometric based, and many a times they may stop out biometrics and detain us within the campus. It's like house arrest. The freedom given to the students is 0. The college conducts no official student/dorm parties. Even during the Riviera cultural fest concerts, there are barricades which separate boys and girls so that they couldn't dance and enjoy together. There was a Silent disco conducted by a club and in that too the boys and girls were separated in the hall by a barricade and a security guard kept a watch on everyone. There are overly strict anti-PDA rules in the college. There are Red-tag security guards installed in the college whose duty is to be a vigilante over the students. Even if a couple is walking together, that security guard may get pissed and whistle at them, humiliate them and snatch their ID cards. The college has no student council and anyone who dares to raise his voice against the strict college rules are condemned and punished by suspending and rusticating. They justify this by saying that any kind of defamation to the college will not be tolerated. The students are afraid even to write their views openly on quora, so if they ever write anything against unjust college rules they do it anonymouslyThe placement record is very impressive of VIT. Almost all of the students get placed in the end. Placement is 100%. There are over 500-700 which come to the college to offer placements. Those companies are categorised as Super Dream companies and Dream Companies. Super Dream are those which offer a very high package (10+ lakh per annum). For example, Amazon, Google, Directi, Adobe, Microsoft, etc. Then there are Dream companies which offer 6-10 lakh package. Apart from these there are Mass Recruiting Companies (such as TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, Wipro, Infosys) which come to the campus and recruit the students in bulk. They offer a package of around 4-6 lakh per annum. The highest salary package goes upto 40 lakh per annum. The average is around 6 lakh per annum. The college also encourage and provide for Summer and Winter Internships. The placement cell of the college is very active for offering internships. The E-Cell (entrepreneurship cell) also conducts various events such as E-Summit where recruiters and officials from various companies visit the college and interact with the students and offer them internships. Internships could be with or without stipend based on the merit and profile of the student.",7.5
1757,Akshad Garje,BMS College of Engineering - [BMSCE],"As if I am in mechanical engineering, the placements for mechanical are not upto that level. A few core companies come, but their expectations are quite high, if you score well throughout your course, there is a chance you will be placed in core, otherwise you have to opt for TCS and IT companies. CSE, IT, ETX have a moderate placement record. The college will try to show you 100 % record but it is not correct. you can assume not more than 50% placements from overall branches.Mostly all the festivals are celebrated here. Festivals like Diwali, Christmas, etc. which are celebrated here with full enthusiasm. VIT is also known for its tech fest, Gravitas, which is conducted in month of October, and cultural fest, Riviera, which is generally conducted in February.

1759,Hardhik Pinjala,IIT Madras - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITM],"Gender ratio is a tad bit off, it's 200girls in a batch of 1000 students. There's hostel nights as such where you can gather and have fun like BBQ night where the hostel budget pays for your BBQ. There's a lot of clubs like chess club, drama club, elecfest club etc. There's groupism based off of the region you are from, owing to the language similarity but no discrimination as such. We are inclusive of all views and opinions and choices.The course curriculum for a freshie is rather uninteresting but the courses from the sophomore years onwards that are offered by said department are very heavy and useful if you're into research. Labs now are all introductory to the department, so, pretty simple. Once we start conducting experiments on some of the most expensive equipment in the country, I'm sure it will get more hectic.",8.7
1760,Sarthak deore,Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology - [KIIT],"Sports, art, and other facilities are of class 1 category. Gender ratio is quite imbalanced. And the college is full of Bengalis you don't see much diversity. Some of the faculties are partial to the students from other region.

Though college provides ample amount of opportunities for internship and foreign internships.",8.8
1761,PRANJAL TIWARI,VIT Bhopal University,"The course I chise is very good according to me as we have great teachers with great knowledge our max facultues are Phd's from IIT and NIT.

The exam criteria is very simple if we understand it the first exam we give is CAT-1 that us continuous assessment test 1 and then similarly is CAT-2 and then the final exam TEE that is term end examination. It is important to scire above 20 marks out off 50 in both the CAT examination and above 40 in term end out off 100. Since the teachers are great and they teach with such a interest that exams don't seem ti be that difficult as we thought it would be.Our college organizes many events such as techfest, international conferences, etc it is very interesting I attended certain seminars and workshops it is so useful as it tell us about new technologies and all things. Their are certain management programs also held in our college like one was being done by IIT-Bombay it was so good.

The college has no rules that one should bow talk to opposite gender, everything is ok to do but management and teaching faculty maintains the distance from the NON Tamil speaking students. Religion, Caste and everything is ignored and nobody cares about that.",7.3
1764,Prashant mishra,TKM College of Engineering - [TKMCE],"The college also provides good scholarships. Most of the poor students appyy for the scholarship every year. They get scholarships from central government and also from state government. the college takes much responsibility to inform the students about the scholarship at the right time.All the extra curricular activities are good enough in my college. The annual athletic meet is conducted at a very high level as we have so many students from sports quota and all.

I secured a score of 334 out of 600 and a rank of 11378. Thus I got admission in the college. I had chosen the civil engineering field.The college faculties and management provides us with great opportunities to showcase our skills.

1767,Aayush,Vellore Institute of Technology - [VIT University],"I gave the entrance exam called viteee for getting admission into vit. Besides this, I gave jee mains and jee advance. I had 96. 38 percentile in jee mains and qualified for jee advance. But I didn't get a seat in BTech Cs or IT program at my current merit. I may get some other branches like mechanical or civil. But since my interest was in cs I looked for other options than IIT or nits. This first name after iits and nits is bits Pilani but then it's exam had a different pattern than regular jee. So same for bits didn't score well enough to get cs. Now comes viteee. It had a similar pattern with jee but had some twist in its questions. I mean some types of questions were different than those in jee syllabus and also it contains 15 English questions. Vitesse contains 30 Physics 30 chemistry 40 maths and 15 English questions of each 1 mark and I have to complete them in 3 hrs. There was no negative marking as time was less. Out of 115 marks score, around 90 may secure a seat of Cs or IT in vit Vellore campus. So I got a rank of around 7000 out of around 1. 25 lakh students who gave the exam and got admission into IT branch for Btech in vit Vellore.There are a lot of extracurricular activities held throughout the year. Workshops will there at any time you say at any day as there are hundreds of clubs and chapters in our college. But the thing is sine them recruitment the students who already know something. So there is a lot of competition in those clubs and chapters. Also, many people sometimes force you to join a club or attend any workshop just to say that they convinced these many people to attend their workshop. On gender(girl/boy ratio) ratio I will say as it is engineering college it is less but it's okayish. Also, vit has offered some kind of schemes like a scholarship or something like that for girls to increase the ratio. But there are many restrictions on girls like their time of college is 2 hrs earlier than that of boys. Also, there are red tag annas (gourds) who watch for PDAs and take action s against it. So I will say this section has a lot more to improve in our college.",7.2

Conversations with your college counselor about what’s important to you in terms of academics, campus culture, and financial aid will help guide your overall college search. Research is a must. Attend college fairs, consult our college profiles, and visit campuses to find and compare potential schools. Check out majors, dorms, clubs, career services, and other key features. You’ll end up with a list of dream, match, and safety schools —any of which I s a great fit for your specific personality and interests. How many colleges do students apply to? According to our 2018 College Hopes & Worries Survey, 40% of students plan to apply to 5-8 schools, while 30% will apply to 9 or more colleges. Read More: Browse College Profiles
3. College Applications
When it comes time to apply, you’ll have some decisions to make. Will you apply early? Many colleges allow applicants to submit their materials for an early deadline (sometime in the fall) that falls before the regular deadline (usually sometime in January or February). Learn about early action vs early decision. The key components of the college application are your transcript, score reports, letters of recommendation, and application essay. Colleges will also ask you to list your extracurricular activities. Learn everything you need to know about college application. Always check admissions requirements with each individual school. Schools may have different requirements regarding number of SAT Subject Tests or whether they require you to take the SAT or ACT essay. The Common Application makes it easy to apply to multiple schools, but schools will typically have different supplemental essay topics or test score requirements. You may decide to interview with an admissions representative or college alumni member to learn more about schools—and to help schools learn more about you. Read More: 24-hr College Essay Review
4. Applying for Financial Aid
Debt has been the biggest concern among respondents to our College Hopes & Worries survey for the past three years. Educate yourself on how financial aid works, so you can make the right choices for you and your family. Schools usually have their own net-price calculators so that families can get a sense of what their out-of-pocket costs would look like. Check out each prospective school's financial aid website as you research your college list. Be aware that applying to college and applying for financial aid are two separate processes. You’ll start with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid ( FAFSA ), which as of October 2016 will be released on October 1 of every year. The form asks for information about your income and the size of your household to determine your expected family contribution (EFC) toward your college tuition. Schools may also use their own forms, or use the CSS Profile for non-federal aid. Your financial aid package is intended to meet your need and will consist of
grants and scholarships
federal work-study
student loans
Plenty of outside organizations offer scholarships tailored to academic interests, talents, extracurricular activities, career goals, geographic location, and many more factors. Keep an eye on deadlines which could fall as early as the summer before senior year. Read More: FAFSA Deadlines, Dates, and FAQs
5. Choosing Your School
Once the notifications start rolling in, celebrate your acceptances with your college counselor, and make your final decision (typically by May 1, “Decision Day”). How to decide? 42% of respondents told us they’d choose the college that's the ""best for their career interests"" and another 40% said they'd choose the college that’s the ""best overall fit. ""
Get excited about the schools that accepted you by talking to real students on campus, learning more about key programs and on-campus activities, and touring dorms and other facilities. Compare financial aid packages to determine which one makes the most financial sense for you. If your dream college waitlisted you, don’t despair. You could still be accepted from the waitlist, as students notify the college whether they accept or decline. Check out our college waitlist strategies. Students may be deferred (their application held to be evaluated at another time) if a college decides they need more information (like senior year grades or test scores) before making their decision. You may also decide to defer your acceptance for a year to work, travel, or volunteer. Learn more about taking a gap year. Test Your College Knowledge

1803,Gurpreet Singh Sethi,Lovely Professional University - [LPU],"through eamcet exam merit A college (Latin: collegium) is an educational institution or a constituent part of one. A college may be a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, a part of a collegiate or federal university, an institution offering vocational education, or a secondary school. In the United States, ""college"" may refer to a constituent part of a university or to a degree-awarding tertiary educational institution, but generally ""college"" and ""university"" are used interchangeably, [1] whereas in the United Kingdom, Oceania, South Asia, Southern Africa, most of Europe and Africa, and Canada, ""college"" may refer to a secondary or high school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher education provider that does not have university status (often without its own degree-awarding powers), or a constituent part of a university (See this comparison of British and American English educational terminology for further information). Etymology	Edit The word ""college"" is from the Latin verb Lego, leggero, legit, tectum, ""to collect, gather together, pick"", plus the preposition cum, ""with"", [2] thus meaning ""selected together"". Thus ""colleagues"" are literally ""persons who have been selected to work together"". In ancient Rome a collegium was a ""body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild"".[3] Thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial legal person (body/corpus) with its own legal personality, with the capacity to enter into legal contracts, to sue and be sued. In mediaeval England there were colleges of priests, for example in chantry chapels; modern survivals include the Royal College of Surgeons in England (originally the Guild of Surgeons Within the City of London), the College of Arms in London (a body of heralds enforcing heraldic law), an electoral college (to elect representatives), etc. all groups of persons ""selected in common"" to perform a specified function and appointed by a monarch, founder or other person in authority. As for the modern ""college of education"", it was a body created for that purpose, for example Eton College was founded in 1440 by letters patent of King Henry VI for the constitution of a college of Fellows, priests, clerks, choristers, poor scholars, and old poor men, with one master or goMy course is quite different from that of others as in India in the upcoming years the need for Artificial Intelligence, Hacking, Programming will be more as compared to the other streams of B. tech

St. Teresa’s College being a womens college all the students would equally say that the bathroom facility the college offers for about 2000 students is like 15-20 bathrooms which is horrible and very unhygenic with broken taps and pipes.I got admission in this college through TNEA counselling. It is a chain process. If you pass in 12th std with minimum pass marks, you need to apply for the counselling in online. Then you need to fill the choicelist.

The best placement record is of IT AND CSE which goes upto 39 Lacs but only for 5-6 students. There are many students in the range of 7-15 Lacs package if their academic and skills record is good.

1864,Plaash Chhokra,Chitkara University - [CU],"Now talking about the course there course is good and teachers are also hard working there. But still the worse this is the attendance criteria i.e 75% if your attendance is less than this you'll be not allowed to sit in the exams and at last you have to pay1500rupee as your supplementry exam fee for per subject. And one more thing theother worst thing are the EXAMS there are almost 2exams in every month like school system Fa's and then ST'S the students doesn't get free due to this shit. in my words for the hostellers This college is a ""BOARDING SCHOOL"" at the time of admissions they the College is 5day working but actually alomost every Saturday the college is open. Here students cannot focus on their extra curricular activities but only they can do is acedamics. due to the college's shitty acedemic system wich is not like other engineering colleges in India.My jee rank was very low still they gave me admission and the funny part was that there were almost 1700students who were pursuing CSE from there. Just because of college's good placements.course starts in august month. The administration take almost 3500rupees for just as councelling fee and on the councelling day the do just nothing and give you streams of your choice and just recheck your grades which you have submitted in the form.and for this thing they charge 3500as councelling fee.",5.5
1865,Student (Anonymous),Graphic Era Hill University - [GEHU],"The primary reason for me was affordability. This is one of the more affordable colleges out there. The infrastructure is very good,on par with any other good private college. Another reason why I chose this college over others was because of how good the college's computer science department is. The highest placement easily goes north of 45 lpa each year. Not only that, multiple students acquire packages above 20 lpa. So yes, as far as exposure is concerned,it definitely stands out from others.The infrastructure is decent. What the college lacks in sports facilities and wifi is more than made up for in the size of the library and lab equipment.

3) Securities are strict to restrict students who are not eligible.
Negative:
1) The co-ordinators of the class should be more strict if a student is absent to college. ( They are already good but, need more concentration).
2) Some students(not tee-totallers) aren't at all good to listen classes and do some worst businesses in college.
3) The crowds of the students will be elsewhere around the college all the time. (Class bunkers)The course is really with good lectures and everyone is friendly and with good knowledge. Focusing on research, I will give 3/5 ranking in my college. It's not too bad. It goes good with mechanical guys and CSE students. They'll conduct computer based language learning programs, many contests and all. Coming to the exams, yes they'll conduct labs sufficiently but not too frequent. They'll be chilling all the day.

For instance I don't understand where in my life as an agriculture engineer I'm gonna use Fourier series and Partial Differential equations. Such things are very frustrating about the course. Most of the labs are very relevant and understandable.We have a technical symposium and non technical cultural events. Each department have their own technical symposium. Non technical events like sports day and hostel day are common for all. And the most important of all and the very useful event is the Innovation Day.

2358,Aleti Jaya Krishna Chaitanya,IIT Goa - Indian Institute of Technology - [IITG],"In IIT's, people are admitted through an entrance exam. I've written JEE Advanced for it. Actually, to be eligible for Advanced exam, we have to qualify JEE Mains before that. The JEE Mains Score can get you into some top NIT's, IIIT's, GFTI's. But to get into IIT's, as an undergraduate, you have to give JEE Advanced exam. After qualifying in the JEE Advanced, you will be asked to fill some choices of the college and branch that you wish to pursue. Initially, they will conduct two mock rounds, so that the aspirant gets an idea of how the counseling process will be done. While the mock rounds are in process, you can change your choices. But, if once the deadline of choice filling is over, you'll not be able to change them throughout the whole process. There will be 7 rounds of counseling. The counseling process is being done by the JOSAA( Joint Seat Allocation Authority). After these 7 rounds of counseling, we have another 2 special rounds of counseling which will be done for allocating the vacant seats in NIT's, IIIT's and GFTI's. The first 7 rounds are final for the admission into an IIT. After the counseling process, you will be asked to come to a nearby Document verification centre for verification. Then, at the end you will be given a letter of admission approval which you have to produce at the institute when you go for admission. A similar process will be done at the institute at the time of admission. I've chosen Mathematics and Computing branch in IIT Goa. I'm extremely interested in Mathematics and I love to code. I wanna go further in Mathematical studies. It's by pure virtue of myself.Our Course Curriculum is well structured and covers the topics which are of more demand now in the world. In the beginning of the semester (An year contains two semesters), after 2-3 weeks, we usually have quizzes(exams) and then we have Mid-Semester exams. After these, we have quizzes again after a month. In the end we have End-Semester exams (Final exams). In the beginning, the exams and labs would not be frequent and we would get some free time.

2390,Shashank Yaduvanshi,DIT University - [DIT],"I had made up my mind to pursue engineering. So first of all I went to the website of DIT UNIVERSITY and filled the online application form. In the online application form they ask you about your basic details, 10th,12th marks and percentage, JEE Main score and the branch you wish to select. Then I went to the University for three counseling process. In the counseling process the College gives a briefing of the various courses and branches offered by College and counsels about the branch and course that would be perfect for you. Then I selected B.Tech CSE course. Then I had to pay the fees and that's it, admission done.
There is no such interviewing process involved in the engineering courses but I don't know about other courses.
I had made up my mind to pursue engineering after class 12th so that made me choose B.Tech course. The branch you choose in B.Tech course is very crucial. I had previously made a mistake taking up the wrong branch(CIVIL ENGINEERING) in GBPUAT,Pantnagar which was not in my interest and was not meant for me and because of which I ended up wasting my 1 year. Then I left GBPUAT and then took admission in DIT UNIVERSITY. So this time while taking admission in DIT UNIVERSITY I took the branch of my interest which was Computer Science and Technology.The placements and job opportunities in the University are getting better year by year. The highest package is 25LPA and 4.5LPA average package. Over 300 recruiters visit the College each year. Students have been placed in international composites like Google, Amazon, SAP, Adobe, IBM,etc.

Thereafter, based on the rank ( which was based on the total score ), we were alloted seats in streams of our choice.The course provides ample opportunity to explore our own stream as wel as coordinate with peers of other courses to collaborate on projects. It's a bit marks oriented aand the compulsory attendance of 75% is a bit disappointing. The routine in general is hectic and the exams do cause stress. But trhis can be perceived as a training mechanism for the corporate world.",8.3
2575,Nithish JP,Amrita School of Engineering - [ASE],The fee is quite high unless there is a scolorship availed by you. Hostel fee is a high as there is no proper food facility and no nonveg in the hostel mess. There is no included dhobi and room cleaning service. But the charge is comparitively high compared to other colleges.Exam structures and course curriculum is really good.

College is not at all good they have just good building, except that everything is below par, teachers are not helpful some teachers arr very arrogant, toilets are also non functional, hostel facility is absolutely poor no rule and regulations,rooms walls are infected with fungus, almiras are too small and there are 4 students packed in one room, girls hostel are very good they are modern rooms and facilities, this type of discrimination should not happen,but we can't do anything. Food quality is pathetic i cordially invite (anyone whose reading) just come and taste the food then only you'll get to know the condition. Lunch is good but breakfast and dinner is pathetic, sometimes they dont even give food and say that there's no gas,then we have to manage ourselves, toilets are broken,water is not good(pimples appeared on my whole body) everyone is suffering from oily skin and face marksEverything is based on theoretical learning and exams, they don't give a damn about students, practical should performed more often than theoretical work but here is everything opposite, marking scheme is also poor, i cun understand if some students fail, that's okay but whole sections got re examination than there's something to do with the marking scheme and checking standards.",3.2

It is not correct.Our college don't have big ground. We have indoor games like basket ball, volleyball, badminton, table tennis, carroms, chess etc. We used to go another college to play cricket of our matrusri educational academy. All are equal in terms of gender religion etc.",8.8
2581,Arnav gupta,Chandigarh University - [CU],The faculty of the college is not that good. Some are good but many aren't that good. They dont know much of their subjects. The university needs to change the entire faculty. And bring some who is more knowledgeable and innovative. Many have done m. tech and came here to teach us. But they don't really know how to teach. There is a need of improvement in the faculty.The course curriculum is good. Syllabus is quite good. But the content they are teaching us not below expectations. We need more good content of the syllabus. The content doesn't focuses on research. The labs are fine. There is not such problems in the lab. But there is s chance of improvement.,6.3
2582,Saran T,Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology,There are total of 2 semesters for each year of course.

Atlast 40+10 total 50 internal marks and the semester exam conducted for 100 marks contributes 50 marks. Therefore 50 internals +50 semester gives 100 marks.The most attractive is all about anti- ragging cell maintained by the college to avoid ragging and to built up a good relationship among seniors and juniors. This made the junior senior interation friendly which inturns seniors gives motivational session periodically to boost up the the juniors in their studies.,8.3

After that you will be called for your counselling based on your rank in the examination. There are no fixed seats or limited seats. These are decided into categories and depending on it your fees will be decided. Higher category, higher fees per year. Do check the website for all the documents required at the time of counselling, specially the demand draft. After that you will be instructed on how to present the documents on the day of admission, booking of hostels and messes, buses for day scholars.The college has its own cultural events and fests. If you are in the organising comitee, it is very good or else try to enjoy the festivals and events. There are a lot of restrictions in celebration of festivals and concerts.

2586,Rushikesh Badgujar,Shree Ramchandra College of Engineering - [SRCOE],"Now there is a lot to talk but I would mention here in short.
1. CAMPUS- the campus is not a square field area, it's a straight road to which one side is a whole college building and the road is of a compound wall with trees plants to the whole route. its good, campus includes garden which is jot maintained well also there is two separate hostels for students along will mess and the bad thing is there is no stationary store in the college campus or nearby. every time we have to run to the BJS road to get such help.
The campus is not that big but the huge road will complete your wish to walk.
2. EXTRACURRICULAR- no comments.
3. GENDER RATIO- fewer girls more boys.
4. LABS- Labs are not fully equipped though we feel less satisfied with the availability of all the equipment on time on place.
But when it comes to particular syllabus practicals that have all the equipment mention therein.
More after we have very good availability of internet connection and WiFi connection in the computer lab.
5. ROBOTICS- I would laugh at this.
See its not like I don't like my college, I do.
Bjt there is a lot to improve and develop as college is not that old and has to develop from all edges.I have no idea about placements but looking to other students opinion and seniors I can guess the placement cell is not enough strong. And overall after completing a full course when the student comes out with the skills are not enough for the market looks. Hence seems like fewer placements done. Rest, as I said very few companies do come here. Afterwards, it's up to the students how better he is with his skills and qualities.
But still, college doesn't play a great role to make one so as

With not even politics being allowed. Many extra curricular activities take place here and you can surely apply for them.The placement for CSE here is 100%. The rest as we know it, due to it being in a C grade college list. mostly IT companies and mass recuriters will come here with an approx 3. 5 LPA package.

It is completely natural environment surrounded by trees and lakes and different types of flowers. The academic section is not far from the hostel. So its good to not miss the classes because you're late. There are two buses that runs at the time of classes to pick IP the students to their classes. Here various type of festival of college is celebrates like Tecnoisis(technical fest), Incandescence (cultural fest). Students from different parts of the country come to participate here. The negative thing is the location of the college. It is located in a hilly area. The train here runs at an average speed of 27-30 km/h. So you have to wait a lot to reach there while in the train.There are 8 semesters(4 years) for the B. Tech course. Everyone has to pass the each semester for the degree. In each semester(6 months), a student has to appear major exams, one after 2 or 3 months, and other after the end of 6 months. In between the two exams, there is a minor test which each student must appear. The grading system here is absolute not relative. So every student must perform of their own.

The fees structure is not that feasible as the college is not providing us enough facilities.I wrote Kerala Engineering Entrance Exam and got admission in this College through allotment. The yearly fees is as low as 12k. But the college isn't even worth that. The officials and faculties behaved very friendly during the admission process, but once the classes started, their whole attitude changed and started behaving so rudely and irresponsibly.",3.3

In the first year basic engineering courses are taught. in the second year, the depth knowledge is given to you with coming 2 years to learn more about it. Exams are held on a regular basis. 1 external exam and 2 internal exams per semester. Internal Exams are held after a couple of months and External at the final end of one semester. Classes becomes hectic as it starts from 8 Am till 3 pm and it makes you tired after such classes each consisting of one hour each with a tea beak and lunch break of 15 and 45 minutes respectively. Rest everything depend upon you how you cover your syllabus.Almost all the teachers are well qualified with either a Post Doctorate degree or Masters degree. Talking about the Interest that teachers gives to student in the class is well defined by the way of teaching. Smart way of teaching helps students to grasp more about the concept and everything is taught in english only avoiding their local language. But I dont like the attitude of some teachers in the college who do whatever they like to. they dont teach properly either by not making us understand or just by opening ppt slides in the classrooms and telling to copy the notes.",8.2

In my course, I found have met till date only 2 professors to be having teaching attitude. Overall The faculties are well educated and are able to handle all workload of academics and are well enthusiastic for the research part which is quite necessary for our nation.In my college, Admission is through JEE - ADVANCED examination conducted by different IITs under JEE council board. There were two steps both having merit list, first one was JEE MAIN conducted by MHRD, NTA then comes JEE_ADVANCED and those students who qualified in a specific range of ranks are proceeded further for admission in IITs through JoSSA counselling and various steps including document Verification and ordering of your preferences of IITs, and finally authorised letter by JoSSA that is required during admission process in IIT.",7.7

The teachers teach in such a manner that we students already know most of the things that he is going to teach. In one semester we have two quizzes and one end semester exam.

There are separate fuels and courts for every sport but everything has to be paid extra and the ones in the hostels are less maintained. Labs are equipped with state of the art facilities. There are also various extracurricular activities in the college.All the faculty in VIT are among the best and highly qualified though some are less experienced in teaching but have very high qualifications. Every faculty member has their own influence among the academic point of view where they can help you get internships and extra curricular studying from other institutes.,6.8

He don't have any concept of physics just makes us write big big paragraph which he wrote on the blackboard by looking at a reference book. Nobody even attends his classes. Chemistry lab and B.Electrical lab faculties are very professional and makes the complex experiments very simple. We have 6 shops in the workshop i.e Machine shop, Carpentry shop, Fitting Shop, Smithy Shop, Welding Shop and Sheet Metal shop. All the faculties of workshop are very well trained and helps us a lot but the faculty of Carpentry shop is unable to communicate properly as neither his english nor hindi is fluent.I had dream of making smartphones from my childhood only, i had designed the pop up camera concept when i wass in 8th standard, but the A4 paper in which i have drawn was lost and i still regret about that. So the craze of smartphones made me choose Electronics and Communication Engineering. And after interacting with seniors i got to know ECE branch of this college is the best. Even better than CSE, and that made me happy. There are 8 semesters and each semester contains 2 major exams that is mid term and end term.

With this responsibility comes great pride and joy. Therefore all teachers should strive for what can be considered to be a ""good teacher."" A good teacher can be defined as someone who always pushes students to want to do their best while at the same time trying to make learning interesting as well as creative. A positive or negative influence from a teacher early on in life can have a great effect on the life of a child. Teachers, especially at the elementary level, must be very creative with their teaching styles. Not every child learns the same way, nor are they interested in the same things. It is difficult to keep the attention of 15-20 children under the age of ten. Faculty is good.Average placement and also provide internship as i am 1st year student so i don't know much about it.This really doesn't matter from which college you are, If you have potential you have ways. You can always try off campus placements if your college fails to provide it in campus. All the people we hear about like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs all are college dropouts, they all even don't have their college degrees. They got talent hence they fly their own way. So my friend focus on skill development, if you are in good university with high placements then its good but if not then don't look at ground because you can fly your own way.
