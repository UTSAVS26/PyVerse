## Example

Here’s an example of how to use the AI-Powered Study Assistant:

### Input:
```text

Here are ten random facts across various topics:

1. **Octopuses Have Three Hearts**: Two pump blood to the gills, where it picks up oxygen, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. Interestingly, the heart that delivers blood to the body stops beating when the octopus swims, which is why they prefer crawling.

2. **Bananas Are Berries**: In botanical terms, a berry is a fruit produced from the ovary of a single flower with seeds embedded in the flesh. By this definition, bananas qualify, while strawberries do not.

3. **Wombat Poop Is Cube-Shaped**: Wombats produce cube-shaped droppings to mark their territory. This unique shape prevents the feces from rolling away, helping them communicate with others.

4. **The Eiffel Tower Can Be 15 cm Taller in Summer**: The iron structure of the Eiffel Tower expands when heated, causing it to grow slightly during warmer months due to thermal expansion.

5. **A Day on Venus Is Longer Than a Year on Venus**: Venus has an extremely slow rotation on its axis, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. In contrast, it orbits the sun in about 225 Earth days.

6. **Honey Never Spoils**: Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey’s low moisture content and acidic pH make it an inhospitable environment for bacteria.

7. **The Shortest War in History Lasted 38 Minutes**: The Anglo-Zanzibar War of 1896 is the shortest recorded war in history, fought between the British Empire and the Sultanate of Zanzibar on August 27, 1896.

8. **The World's Largest Desert Is Antarctica**: While many people think of deserts as hot, sandy places, a desert is defined by its low precipitation. Antarctica is the largest desert in the world, covering over 14 million square kilometers.

9. **Butterflies Taste With Their Feet**: Butterflies have taste sensors on their feet, allowing them to taste and identify suitable plants for laying eggs just by landing on them.

10. **Sharks Have Been Around Longer Than Trees**: Sharks have existed for more than 400 million years, while the earliest trees appeared about 350 million years ago. This means sharks predate trees by approximately 50 million years!
