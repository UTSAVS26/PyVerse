ML Project Title: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
üéØ Goal
The main goal of this project is to develop machine learning models for predicting stock prices based on historical data. The objective is to classify whether the stock price will increase or decrease the next day and to predict the actual stock prices for regression.

üßµ Dataset
This project utilizes a dataset containing historical stock market data. The dataset includes the following columns:

Date: The date of the stock prices.
Open: The opening price of the stock.
High: The highest price of the stock during the day.
Low: The lowest price of the stock during the day.
Close: The closing price of the stock.
Volume: The number of shares traded.
Target: The target variable for regression (stock prices).
üßæ Description
This project involves implementing a stock price prediction system using machine learning techniques with Python. Key components include:

Data Loading: Loading the dataset from a CSV file and preprocessing it.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and defining the target variables for both classification and regression tasks.
Missing Values Handling: Using Simple Imputer to address missing values in the dataset.
Data Splitting: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for both classification and regression tasks.
Feature Scaling: Scaling the features using StandardScaler to improve model performance.
üßÆ What You Have Done
Implemented data preprocessing steps, including date conversion and setting the date as an index.
Constructed features for predicting stock price movement (classification) and actual prices (regression).
Handled missing values in the dataset effectively.
Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
Scaled the features to standardize the input for machine learning algorithms.
üöÄ Models Implemented
The following machine learning classification models were implemented to predict stock price movements:

Logistic Regression: A model to predict the probability of stock price increase or decrease.
Random Forest: An ensemble model that improves prediction accuracy through multiple decision trees.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that works well on high-dimensional spaces.
k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN): A simple yet effective model for classification based on feature similarity.
Neural Networks (MLP): A multi-layer perceptron for complex classification tasks.
Gradient Boosting: An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to minimize prediction error.
üìö Libraries Needed
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms, preprocessing, and evaluation metrics.
Matplotlib: For data visualization (if used for visualizing results).
