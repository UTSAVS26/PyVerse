## Apple and Pear Scab

Apple and pear scab are two different diseases that look very similar and are controlled in similar manners in home gardens and landscapes. Both cause spotting and scabbing of fruit, especially during wet springs but different fungi cause them.The fungus Venturia inaequalis causes apple scab. Apple scab is a serious disease of apples in California, resulting in loss due to severe surface blemishing of fruit. It is most severe in coastal and foothill areas where spring and early summer weather is cool and moist. However, it can be a problem wherever apples grow when conditions are favorable for pathogen development. Apple scab also is a problem on ornamental crabapple.Pear scab, which the fungus V. pirina causes, results in similar blemishes on pear fruit.The disease is most prevalent in the North Coast production area. However, V. pirina won’t affect apples nor can the apple scab fungus cause problems on pears. Both have quite limited host ranges.

### IDENTIFICATION

Scab first appears as yellow, or chlorotic, spots on leaves. As the disease progresses, dark, olive-colored spots form on leaves, fruit, and—in severe cases—stems. Spots on the undersurface of leaves sometimes look velvety due to fungal growth. Affected leaves might twist or pucker; in minor cases, this will affect only a few, irregularly scattered leaves, but if the disease is severe, all foliage could show symptoms. Severely affected leaves often turn yellow and drop.When scab affects flower stems, it can cause flowers to drop. Scabby spots can appear on fruit later in the season. These begin as velvety or sooty, gray-black (and sometimes greasy looking) lesions that sometimes have a red halo. The lesions later become sunken and tan and can have areas of olive-colored spores around their margins. Severely infected fruit becomes distorted and usually drops from the tree. Fruit also can crack, which allows entry of secondary organisms.

### LIFE CYCLE
Both apple and pear scab pathogens overwinter primarily in infected leaves on the ground. Rainfall or sprinkler irrigation is necessary to release the spores. In spring, air currents or splashing water carry these primary spores (ascospores) from the infected leaves to flowers, leaves, or fruit where they germinate and cause primary infections. Pear scab also can overwinter in lesions on pear twigs in high rainfall areas.Secondary spores, or conidia, are produced on infected leaf or fruit surfaces 8 to 17 days following primary infection. In the case of pears, this process also occurs on twig lesions. The disease continues to spread until conditions become dry or the plant tissue becomes more resistant to infection.Infection occurs most rapidly between 55° and 75°F, and leaves or fruit must remain wet continuously for a minimum of 9 hours for initial infection to occur at these temperatures. If spring weather is dry from the green tip stage of bloom (when flowers are still green and petals aren’t showing yet) through fruit set, scab usually won’t be a problem

### DAMAGE

Scab can destroy an apple or pear crop. Young, infected flowers or fruit can drop, or the fruit can become malformed, cracked, and unsightly, rendering it unusable. Defoliation follows severe, early leaf infection. Late-season infections generally can be tolerated in backyard trees, because peeling the fruit will remove the pinpoint-sized scab lesions.

### MANAGEMENT

Several techniques are available for controlling scab. Advantages of one method over another depend on the number of trees you are managing and whether conditions are ideal for disease development.Cultural Control For a single, backyard tree, removing—then composting or destroying—its dropped leaves in autumn or winter can limit the disease to tolerable levels. In plantings of several trees, additional steps might be necessary to effectively control this disease, especially in cool, moist coastal areas. These include applying zinc and fertilizer-grade urea (or some other nitrogen source) to leaves in autumn to hasten leaf fall and adding lime to leaf piles beneath the tree. In pears, apply urea by itself, because zinc can be phytotoxic.If you are using sprinklers that wet any of the tree’s foliage, irrigate between sunrise and noon to allow adequate drying time, or reduce the angle of the sprinkler

## Cherry Powdery Mildew

### IDENTIFICATION AND DAMAGE

Powdery mildew can be recognized easily on most plants by the white to gray powdery mycelium and spore growth that forms on both sides of leaves, sometimes on flowers and fruit, and on shoots.The disease can be serious on woody plants such as grapevines, caneberries, and fruit trees where it attacks new growth including buds, shoots, and flowers as well as leaves. New growth is dwarfed, distorted, and covered with a white, powdery growth. On apple and grape and to a lesser extent apricot, nectarine, and peach, infected young fruits develop weblike, russetted scars. On tree fruits a rough corky spot on the skin will develop where infection occurred. Grapes with a severe infection may also crack or split and fail to grow and expand.On strawberry, affected leaf edges curl upward. Infected leaves later develop dry, brownish patches along with nondescript patches of white powdery fungus on the lower surface and reddish discoloration on the upper surface. When foliage infections are severe, flowers and fruit may infected.

### LIFE CYCLE

All powdery mildew fungi require living plant tissue to grow. On deciduous perennial hosts such as grapevine, raspberry, and fruit trees, powdery mildew survives from one season to the next in infected buds or as fruiting bodies called chasmothecia, which reside on the bark of cordons, branches, and stems. On strawberry the fungus can survive on leaves that remain on the plants through winter.Most powdery mildew fungi grow as thin layers of mycelium on the surface of the affected plant part. Spores, which are the primary means of dispersal, make up the bulk of the powdery growth and are produced in chains that can be seen with a hand lens. In contrast, spores of downy mildew grow on branched stalks that look like tiny trees. Also downy mildew colonies are gray instead of white and occur mostly on the lower leaf surface.Powdery mildew spores are carried by wind to host plants. Although humidity requirements for germination vary, many powdery mildew species can germinate and infect in the absence of water. In fact, spores of some powdery mildew fungi are killed and germination and mycelial growth are inhibited by water on plant surfaces. Moderate temperatures and shade are generally the most favorable conditions for powdery mildew development, since spores and mycelium are sensitive to extreme heat and direct sunlight.

### MANAGEMENT

The best method of powdery mildew control is prevention. Avoiding the most susceptible varieties and following good cultural practices will adequately control powdery mildew in many situations. However, where conditions are favorable, susceptible fruit trees and berries may require protection with fungicide sprays. Fungicide applications are most often needed on susceptible varieties of apple and on almost all grape and strawberry varieties.

## Grape Black Rot

### Identification

Leaves, flowers, and green or ripe fruit on or near the soil in the dampest or densest areas of the canopy turn light brown and develop a gray or brown fuzzy growth of fungal spores. Occasionally stems may be affected. Fruit or plants shrivel and rot and often develop flattened, hard, black masses, called sclerotia, under rotted parts.

### Life cycle

Following injury, berries are susceptible to invasion by many microorganisms that frequently enter through insect- or bird-feeding sites, mechanical cracks, or lesions. The Botrytis fungus that causes bunch rot survives in decaying plant material in or on the soil and as sclerotia. It usually infects only flowers and senescing or injured tissue, especially plant parts in contact with damp soil. However, green, healthy tissue may be affected. Grapes are infected at the flower stage, but the fungus remains dormant until fruit mature; bunch rot then develops if conditions become cool and damp.

### Solutions

Use planting densities and training techniques that provide maximum air movement through the plant canopy. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizer that will encourage excess growth. Trim leaves around bunches soon after bloom to improve air circulation. Remove diseased plants as soon as they appear, and pick ripened grapes as soon as possible. Harvest fruit in advance of rainy or humid conditions when possible. Fungicides are available but should not be needed if leaves are pruned and no rains occur during bloom. Chemicals are not recommended for summer bunch rot.

## Grape Downy Mildew

### Identification
Downy mildew causes yellowish and oily or angular, yellow to reddish and brown lesions on leaves. Lesions are limited by the veins. Sporulation of the fungus appears as dense, white, cottony growth in the lesions. Infected shoot tips and petioles thicken and curl and eventually turn brown and die. Young berries appear grayish.

### Life cycle
Grape downy mildew occurs mainly in regions where it is warm and wet during the vegetative growth of the vine. Limited rainfall in spring and summer generally reduces the spread of the disease in California. In most regions the fungus survives the winter mainly in fallen leaves. The fungus may also survive in buds and shoot tips. The pathogen is dispersed by splashing rain and wind. The infection process can take less than 90 minutes. Infection generally occurs in the morning and the incubation period is about 4 days. Downy mildew is favored by all factors that increase the moisture content of soil, air, and host plant. Epidemics are promoted principally by rain and irrigation practices.

### Solutions
The best way to control downy mildew is by prevention. Preventative management consists of effective soil drainage and reduction of sources of overwintering inoculum, such as pruning out the infected ends of shoots. Extend the interval between sprinkler irrigations as long as possible.

## Strawberry Leaf Scorch

Leaf scorch causes purple spots to occur on upper leaf surfaces. The spots may run together, leaving the leaf looking burnt or scorched. Fruit may appear streaked or have sunken areas.

##Solutions

Leaf scorch is favored by wet weather. Some varieties may be resistant

## Potato Late Blight

Phytophthora infestans has a wide host range, including tomato, potato, pepper, and eggplant. On leaves, late blight lesions typically first appear as irregular, small pale to dark green water-soaked spots that are surrounded by a zone of yellowish tissue. Lesions may expand rapidly and become brown to purplish black. White sporulation of the fungus may be observed at the periphery of lesions, principally on the underside of leaves. On stems and petioles, lesions are brown to black and may also support sporulation of the fungus. Fruit discoloration usually begins on the upper side of the fruit. Affected fruit remain firm. Tubers develop a firm brown decay.

### Life cycle

Late blight occurs commonly in coastal environments and sporadically elsewhere. The fungus inoculum can originate from seed tubers, cull piles, volunteers, closely related weed hosts such as nightshade, and adjacent plantings of potatoes or tomatoes that are affected. Late blight can develop and spread rapidly if inoculum is present and conditions are conducive. High humidity and average temperatures in the range of 50 to 78°F favor the disease. Air circulation to facilitate the drying of foliage each day is important. Overhead sprinklers can favor late blight.

### Solutions

Use certified plants and tubers. When late blight has developed on foliage and fruit or tubers are at a risk of infection, make sure that vines have been completely dead for 2 – 3 weeks before harvest as the fungus does not survive very long in dead foliage. Avoid sprinkler irrigation. Destroy all tomato, potato, eggplant, and pepper debris after harvest.

## Squash Powdery Mildew 

Powdery mildew is a common disease on many types of plants. There are many different species of powdery mildew fungi (e.g., Erysiphe spp., Sphaerotheca spp.) and each species only attacks specific plants. A wide variety of vegetable crops are affected by powdery mildews, including artichoke, beans, beets, carrot, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, melons, parsnips, peas, peppers, pumpkins, radicchio, radishes, squash, tomatillo, tomatoes, and turnips. Powdery mildews generally do not require moist conditions to establish and grow, and normally do well under warm conditions; thus they are more prevalent than many other leaf-infecting diseases under California’s dry summer conditions.

### IDENTIFICATION AND DAMAGE

Powdery mildew first appears as white, powdery spots that may form on both surfaces of leaves, on shoots, and sometimes on flowers and fruit. These spots gradually spread over a large area of the leaves and stems. An exception is one of the powdery mildews that affects artichokes, onions, peppers, and tomatoes: it produces yellow patches on leaves but little powdery growth.

Leaves infected with powdery mildew may gradually turn completely yellow, die, and fall off, which may expose fruit to sunburn. On some plants, powdery mildew may cause the leaves to twist, buckle, or otherwise distort. Powdery mildew fungal growth does not usually grow on vegetable fruits, although pea pods may get brownish spots. Severely infected plants may have reduced yields, shortened production times, and fruit that has little flavor.

### LIFE CYCLE

All powdery mildew fungi require living plant tissue to grow. Year-round availability of crop or weed hosts is important for the survival of some powdery mildew fungi. Special resting spores are produced, allowing overwinter survival of the species that causes the disease in cucurbits, lettuce, peas, and certain other crops.Most powdery mildew fungi grow as thin layers of mycelium (fungal tissue) on the surface of the affected plant part. Spores, which are the primary means of dispersal, make up the bulk of the white, powdery growth visible on the plant’s surface and are produced in chains that can be seen with a hand lens; in contrast, spores of downy mildew grow on branched stalks that look like tiny trees.Powdery mildew spores are carried by wind to new hosts. Although humidity requirements for germination vary, all powdery mildew species can germinate and infect in the absence of free water. In fact, spores of some powdery mildew fungi are killed and germination is inhibited by water on plant surfaces for extended periods. Moderate temperatures (60° to 80°F) and shady conditions generally are the most favorable for powdery mildew development. Spores and fungal growth are sensitive to extreme heat (above 90°F) and direct sunlight.

### MANAGEMENT

The best method of control is prevention. Planting resistant vegetable varieties when available, or avoiding the most susceptible varieties, planting in the full sun, and following good cultural practices will adequately control powdery mildew in many cases (Table 1). However, very susceptible vegetables such as cucurbits (cucumber, melons, squash, and pumpkins) may require fungicide treatment. Several least-toxic fungicides are available but must be applied no later than the first sign of disease.

### Resistant Varieties

In some cases, varieties resistant to powdery mildew may be available. If available, plant resistant varieties of cantaloupe, cole crops, cucumber, melons, peas, pumpkins, and squash. If you plant more susceptible varieties, you may need to take control measures.
