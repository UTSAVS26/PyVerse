## Potato Image Classification

### Model Overview
In this project, we aim to classify potato plant health into three categories: 

- **Early Blight**
- **Healthy**
- **Late Blight**

### Results
The classification model achieved an impressive accuracy of **98.02%** on the testing dataset. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of our model in distinguishing between healthy plants and those affected by early and late blight.

### Conclusion
The results indicate that the model performs exceptionally well in identifying and classifying potato plant diseases. Further enhancement can be achieved by adding more data and training on additional plant varieties, such as tomato and apple, in future iterations.
