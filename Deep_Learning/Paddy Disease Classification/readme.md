## DESCRIPTION
Paddy Disease Recognition using a CNN and EfficientNetB4 model is aimed at detecting diseases in paddy crops by analyzing images of leaves. Early detection of crop diseases is crucial to ensure better yield and prevent significant loss for farmers. This project seeks to automate the process of recognizing paddy leaf diseases by employing deep learning models, offering a faster and more reliable approach than manual inspection.

### Why is it necessary?
Paddy crops are susceptible to various diseases that can devastate crop yields. Manual inspection is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires expert knowledge. This project provides a solution by automating disease recognition, making it accessible even to farmers with limited resources.

### How is it beneficial?
By automating disease detection, farmers can get real-time feedback on the health of their crops, allowing them to take preventive measures and mitigate losses. This model can be integrated into mobile applications or deployed on drones for large-scale field monitoring.

### How did you start approaching this project?
I began by exploring the dataset, understanding the different disease categories, and then implemented a CNN model to tackle the image classification task. As the project progressed, I integrated EfficientNetB4 to improve performance and achieve better accuracy.

### Additional resources:
- Research papers on EfficientNet and CNN.
- Blogs on paddy disease identification and deep learning.
