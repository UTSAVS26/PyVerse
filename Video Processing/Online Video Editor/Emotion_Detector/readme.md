# 🎭 Real-Time Emotion Detection using OpenCV & Deep Learning

This project detects human emotions in real-time using a webcam feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained deep learning model to classify facial expressions like 
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Sad
- Surprise
- Neutral

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Face detection using Haarcascade
- 😊 Emotion classification using pre-trained `.h5` model
- 📷 Real-time webcam feed processing
- 🖼️ Overlay of predicted emotion on detected faces
- 📌 Footer message with creator credit

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy

## How to Run
```bash
python face_detect.py
