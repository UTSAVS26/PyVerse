Visualising plots
🎯 Goal
The primary objective of this project is to explain your specific project's goal here. It includes implementing, visualizing, and analyzing relevant key features based on the files and project you shared.

🧵 Dataset / Input
This project does not rely on a predefined dataset. Instead, it takes user input in the following formats:

File Upload: Users can upload a file containing the input data. Make sure to follow the input file format described below.
Manual Entry: Users can manually input the data.
File Format Requirements:
File1: Accepts input in format (e.g., CSV, TXT), containing fields such as field_1, field_2, and so on.
File2: Requires format (e.g., JSON), with key fields such as key_1, key_2, etc.
File3: Describes format, with structure <key>: <value>.
File4: Takes file types or formats, and expects the following fields...
Example Input:
Manual Input Format Example:
plaintext
Copy code
field_1: value
field_2: value
...
File Input Example:
csv
Copy code
column_1,column_2,column_3
value_1,value_2,value_3
🧾 Description
This project provides a web-based platform developed using Streamlit that allows users to interact with the system through manual input or file uploads. The tool implements specific project functionalities described in each of the four files (e.g., algorithm, database operations, graph construction).

The interface dynamically updates based on the input, offering real-time feedback on the actions performed, such as building structures, visualizations, or other functional operations (adjust based on your project).

Features:
Real-time visualization of data structures or operations based on user input.
Multiple input modes: manual and file-based.
Dynamic operations that are applied step-by-step to the input data.
🧮 What I Had Done!
Developed an interactive web interface using Streamlit.
Implemented features for file uploading and manual input handling.
Visualized the operations or data structures in real-time.
Provided feedback on every step of the process (e.g., rotations, rebalancing in trees, graph construction).
Output examples based on the input data.
Sample Output (based on the project):
After processing the input, the system generates visualizations, processed data, or other outputs relevant to the task. For example:
Tree Visualization or Graph Construction output:
plaintext
Copy code
[Graph or tree]
Processed Data Output:
plaintext
Copy code
key_1: result_1
key_2: result_2

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Results
No EDA is required as the project is based on user inputs. However, real-time graphical outputs or visual representations of the data processing steps provide insights into how the system operates based on user inputs.

📈 Performance of the Algorithms
Since the project focuses on algorithms like trees, graphs, or other relevant structures (depending on the files), no accuracy metrics are required. Performance can be verified based on the correct execution of:

Rotations and balance maintenance in trees.
Graph construction or other algorithmic outputs.
📢 Conclusion
The project effectively demonstrates how to process user inputs and visualize results in real-time. The system allows for dynamic interaction through both manual entry and file upload, offering flexibility in how users interact with the system.
