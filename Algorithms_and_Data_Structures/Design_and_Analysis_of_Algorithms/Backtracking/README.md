# Backtracking

## What is Backtracking?

**Backtracking** is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems incrementally by building possible solutions and discarding those that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem. It’s a depth-first search approach where we explore all possible paths to find a solution and backtrack whenever we hit a dead-end, i.e., when the current solution cannot be extended further without violating the problem’s constraints.

### Steps of Backtracking:

1. **Choose**: Start with an initial state and make a choice that seems feasible.
2. **Explore**: Recursively explore each choice to extend the current solution.
3. **Backtrack**: If the current choice leads to a dead-end, discard it and backtrack to try another option.

Backtracking efficiently prunes the search space by eliminating paths that do not lead to feasible solutions, making it an ideal approach for solving combinatorial problems.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Recursive Approach**: Backtracking often involves recursion to explore all possible solutions.
- **Exhaustive Search**: It tries out all possible solutions until it finds the correct one or determines none exists.
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Backtracking is well-suited for problems with constraints, where solutions must satisfy certain rules.

## Applications of Backtracking

### 1. **Graph Coloring**

**Graph Coloring** is the problem of assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The challenge is to do this using the minimum number of colors.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Starting with the first vertex, assign a color and move to the next vertex. If no valid color is available for the next vertex, backtrack and try a different color for the previous vertex.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m^n)\), where \(m\) is the number of colors and \(n\) is the number of vertices.
  
- **Use Case**: Scheduling problems, where tasks need to be scheduled without conflicts (e.g., class timetabling).

### 2. **Hamiltonian Cycle**

The **Hamiltonian Cycle** problem seeks a cycle in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting point.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Start from a vertex and add other vertices to the path one by one, ensuring that each added vertex is not already in the path and has an edge connecting it to the previous vertex. If a vertex leads to a dead-end, backtrack and try another path.
  
- **Time Complexity**: Exponential, typically \(O(n!)\), where \(n\) is the number of vertices.
  
- **Use Case**: Circuit design and optimization, where paths or tours need to be found efficiently.

### 3. **Knight's Tour**

The **Knight's Tour** problem involves moving a knight on a chessboard such that it visits every square exactly once.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Starting from a given position, the knight makes a move to an unvisited square. If a move leads to a dead-end (i.e., no further valid moves), backtrack and try a different move.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(8^n)\), where \(n\) is the number of squares on the board (typically \(n = 64\) for a standard chessboard).
  
- **Use Case**: Chess puzzle solvers and pathfinding problems on a grid.

### 4. **Maze Solving**

The **Maze Solving** problem involves finding a path from the entrance to the exit of a maze, moving only through valid paths.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Starting from the entrance, attempt to move in one direction. If the path leads to a dead-end, backtrack and try another direction until the exit is reached.
  
- **Time Complexity**: Depends on the size of the maze, typically \(O(4^n)\) for an \(n \times n\) maze.
  
- **Use Case**: Robotics and AI navigation systems, where the goal is to find the optimal route through a complex environment.

### 5. **N-Queens Problem**

The **N-Queens Problem** is a classic puzzle where the goal is to place \(N\) queens on an \(N \times N\) chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Start by placing the first queen in the first row and recursively place queens in subsequent rows. If placing a queen in a row leads to a conflict, backtrack and try placing it in another column.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N!)\), where \(N\) is the number of queens (or the size of the chessboard).
  
- **Use Case**: Resource allocation and optimization problems, where multiple entities must be placed in non-conflicting positions (e.g., server load balancing).

### 6. **Rat in a Maze**

The **Rat in a Maze** problem involves finding a path for a rat from the source to the destination in a maze represented by a binary matrix.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Start from the source and explore possible moves (usually up, down, left, right). If a move leads to a valid path, continue; otherwise, backtrack and try another direction.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(4^{n^2})\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the size of the maze.
  
- **Use Case**: Pathfinding algorithms, robot navigation in constrained environments.

### 7. **Kth Permutation**

The **Kth Permutation** problem involves finding the kth permutation of a set of n numbers in lexicographic order.

- **Backtracking Approach**: Generate permutations in lexicographic order until the kth permutation is reached. Alternatively, use a more efficient factorial number system approach.
  
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n!)\) for naive approach, \(O(n^2)\) for optimized factorial number system approach.
  
- **Use Case**: Combinatorial problems, generating specific arrangements in lexicographic order.
