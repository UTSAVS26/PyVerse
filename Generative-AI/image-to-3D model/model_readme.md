# VFusion3D: Learning Scalable 3D Generative Models from Video Diffusion Models

VFusion3D is a large, feed-forward 3D generative model trained with a small amount of 3D data and a large volume of synthetic multi-view data. It is the first work exploring scalable 3D generative/reconstruction models as a step towards a 3D foundation.

**Quick Start**
Getting started with VFusion3D is super easy! ðŸ¤— Hereâ€™s how you can use the model with Hugging Face:

**Install Dependencies (Optional)**
Depending on your needs, you may want to enable specific features like mesh generation or video rendering. We've got you covered with these additional packages:

```python
!pip --quiet install imageio[ffmpeg] PyMCubes trimesh rembg[gpu,cli] kiui
```

Load model directly
```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoProcessor

# load the model and processor
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("jadechoghari/vfusion3d", trust_remote_code=True)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("jadechoghari/vfusion3d")

# download and preprocess the image
import requests
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

image_url = 'https://sm.ign.com/ign_nordic/cover/a/avatar-gen/avatar-generations_prsz.jpg'
response = requests.get(image_url)
image = Image.open(BytesIO(response.content))

# preprocess the image and get the source camera 
image, source_camera = processor(image)


# generate planes (default output)
output_planes = model(image, source_camera)
print("Planes shape:", output_planes.shape)

# generate a 3D mesh
output_planes, mesh_path = model(image, source_camera, export_mesh=True)
print("Planes shape:", output_planes.shape)
print("Mesh saved at:", mesh_path)

# Generate a video
output_planes, video_path = model(image, source_camera, export_video=True)
print("Planes shape:", output_planes.shape)
print("Video saved at:", video_path)
```

Default (Planes): By default, VFusion3D outputs planesâ€”ideal for further 3D operations.
Export Mesh: Want a 3D mesh? Just set export_mesh=True, and you'll get a .obj file ready to roll. You can also customize the mesh resolution by adjusting the mesh_size parameter.
Export Video: Fancy a 3D video? Set export_video=True, and you'll receive a beautifully rendered video from multiple angles. You can tweak render_size and fps to get the video just right.
