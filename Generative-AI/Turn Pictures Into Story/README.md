# Turn Images into Story with AI


## Project Overview

This project uses artificial intelligence to generate stories from images. The goal is to create a system that can take an image as input and produce a coherent and engaging story as output.

## How it Works

**Image Input**: The user uploads an image to the system.

**Image Analysis**: The system uses computer vision techniques to analyze the image and extract relevant features such as objects, scenes, and actions.

**Story Generation**: The system uses a natural language processing (NLP) model to generate a story based on the extracted features.

**Post-processing**: The system refines the generated story to ensure coherence, grammar, and readability.

**Features**

**Image Upload**: Users can upload images in various formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF).

**Story Generation**: The system generates a story based on the uploaded image.

**Story Customization**: Users can customize the story by selecting from various genres, tones, and styles.
*
**Image-Story Pairing**: The system allows users to view the original image alongside the generated story.

## Technical Requirements

**Programming Languages**: Python 3.x, JavaScript (for frontend)

**Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras (for image analysis and NLP), React (for frontend)

**Libraries**: OpenCV, Pillow (for image processing), NLTK, spaCy (for NLP)

**Hardware**: GPU acceleration recommended for faster image processing and story generation

**Installation**

**Clone the repository**: git clone https://github.com/NANDAGOPALNG/ML-Nexus/tree/main/Generative%20Models/Turn%20Images%20Into%20Story%20with%20AI

**Install dependencies**: pip install -r requirements.txt

**Set up the environment**: python setup.py

**Run the application**: python app.py

## Usage

Upload an image to the system.
Select the desired story genre, tone, and style (optional).
Click the "Generate Story" button.
View the generated story alongside the original image.
