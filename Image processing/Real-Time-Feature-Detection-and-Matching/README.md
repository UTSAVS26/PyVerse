# Real-Time-Feature-Detection-and-Matching

## Project Overview
This project implements a system that performs real-time feature detection on a video feed using the ORB algorithm. It identifies unique objects in scenes by detecting keypoints and displays them in real time. This project demonstrates the basics of feature detection and can be a foundation for more complex object tracking or automated scene analysis applications.

## Hardware Requirements
- **Camera**: A webcam or external camera to capture the live video feed.
- **Computer or Embedded System**: Capable of running OpenCV with sufficient memory and processing power for real-time image processing.

## Software Requirements
- **OpenCV**: Open-source computer vision library for image and video processing (`opencv-python`).
- **Python**: Version 3.x is recommended for compatibility.
- **Optional**: Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization.

## Resources
- **OpenCV Library**: Includes implementations of the ORB algorithm and Brute-Force Matcher.
- **Camera or Video File**: You can use a webcam or a pre-recorded video file for testing.
- **Sample Dataset (Optional)**: If you want to test using specific videos or images.

## How to Run
1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UTSAVS26/PyVerse/tree/main/Image%20processing/Real-Time-Feature-Detection-and-Matching
   cd Real-Time-Feature-Detection-and-Matching
   ```

3. **Run the Code**:
   - Execute the Python script to start real-time feature detection:
     ```bash
     python Main.py
     ```
   - The script will access your default webcam and display the video feed with detected keypoints highlighted.

4. **Optional: Saving Captured Frames**:
   - You can modify the code to save frames with detected keypoints by adding:
     ```python
     cv2.imwrite('saved_frames/frame_x.jpg', frame_with_keypoints)
     ```
   - This will save the frames in a specified folder, which you need to create in advance.

## Code Explanation
1. **Video Capture Setup**: Captures the video feed from the default webcam.
2. **ORB Detector Initialization**: Uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for real-time keypoint detection.
3. **Real-Time Frame Processing Loop**:
   - Converts each frame to grayscale.
   - Detects keypoints and computes descriptors.
   - Draws keypoints on the frame for visualization.
4. **Display and Exit Condition**: The video feed is displayed, and the program exits when 'q' is pressed.

## Optional: Running in Jupyter Notebook
- If you prefer working with a Jupyter Notebook, you can integrate the code and save the processed images for further analysis.
- Example:
   ```python
   from IPython.display import display, Image
   display(Image(filename='saved_frames/frame_1.jpg'))
   ```

## Potential Enhancements
- **Feature Matching**: Extend the code to match keypoints between frames or different scenes using techniques like Brute-Force Matcher or FLANN.
- **Bounding Box Detection**: Draw bounding boxes around detected objects.
- **Object Tracking**: Implement tracking algorithms to follow objects across multiple frames.
- **Logging and Analysis**: Track detected features over time and log their appearance in a scene.
