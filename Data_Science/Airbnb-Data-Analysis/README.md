# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listing data to uncover trends in pricing, availability, and other key factors. Using Tableau for visualization, the project explores the Airbnb rental market, highlighting patterns based on geographic location, room types, and pricing variations.

## Project Files
- **AirbnbProject.pptx**: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the main insights from the analysis.
- **TableauProject.twbx**: Tableau workbook for creating and exploring interactive visualizations.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are to:
- Analyze Average Price per Bedroom: Assess price variations based on the number of bedrooms.
- Visualize Price Distribution by Zip Code: Identify geographic patterns in pricing.
- Evaluate Weekly Revenue Trends: Observe seasonal and location-based revenue trends.
- Analyze Listings by Bed Type and Bedroom Count: Gain insights into the types of listings and bed availability.

## Key Insights
- **Average Price Per Bedroom**: Larger properties generally have higher average prices, with steep increases for properties with 4+ bedrooms.
- **Price by Zip Code**: Some zip codes show significantly higher prices, possibly indicating more desirable or premium areas.
- **Revenue Trends**: Weekly revenue peaks during certain seasons, reflecting high-travel demand periods.
- **Common Listing Types**: Real beds are the most frequent, and properties with 1-2 bedrooms make up the majority of listings.
