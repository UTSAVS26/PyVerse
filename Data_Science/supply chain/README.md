     - **Top 5 Suppliers by Delivery Performance**: Horizontal bar chart ranking suppliers based on their average delivery time.
     - **Shortage of Risk by Supplier and Items**: Stacked bar chart visualizing shortage risk for items across different suppliers.
   - **Purpose**:
     - Provide an overview of inventory and supplier performance.
     - Highlight potential risks in supply and stock levels.

### 2. **Operational Insights**
   - **Visualizations**:
     - **Forecasted Monthly Demand**: Line chart with forecasting enabled to project future stock requirements based on historical demand.
     - **Days of Inventory on Hand (DOH) Breakdown**: Pie chart summarizing DOH for each category.
     - **Stock Availability Heatmap**: Matrix heatmap showing the stock availability across suppliers and categories.
     - **Delivery Time Analysis by Category**: 100% stacked bar chart comparing delivery times across suppliers for each category.
     - **Top 5 High-Risk Items**: Table displaying items with high shortage risk, along with their stock levels and reorder levels.
   - **Purpose**:
     - Predict future demand and ensure proactive stock replenishment.
     - Highlight high-risk items and optimize supplier selection.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. **Interactive Filters**:
   - Located on the Operational Insights page, use filters for categories, suppliers, and shortage risks to refine the data displayed across visualizations.
2. **Analyze Trends**:
   - Use the forecasted demand line chart to predict future stock needs.
   - Identify patterns in delivery times and supplier performance.
3. **Focus on Risks**:
   - Monitor shortage risks through the pie chart and high-risk item table.
   - Investigate categories or suppliers with low stock levels or high risks.

## Insights and Recommendations
- **Supplier Management**:
  - Suppliers with higher delivery times (e.g., Supplier Z) may need improvement or alternative sourcing options.
- **Stock Optimization**:
  - Categories like Electronics and Food have higher stock availability; these may need regular review to avoid overstocking.
  - High-risk items (e.g., Item A, Item B) require immediate replenishment.
- **Forecasting Insights**:
  - Leverage forecasted demand to maintain an optimal inventory level and reduce the chances of shortages or overstocking.

## Tools and Features Used
- **Power BI Visualizations**:
  - Line charts, bar charts, pie charts, heatmaps, and gauge visualizations.
  - Filters for interactivity and deeper data exploration.
- **Forecasting Feature**:
  - Enabled on the "Forecasted Monthly Demand" chart for projecting stock requirements.
- **Data Modeling**:
  - Measures for calculating inventory turnover, average DOH, and shortage risks.

## Conclusion
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for supply chain managers, enabling better visibility into inventory levels, supplier performance, and operational risks. By utilizing the insights from this dashboard, stakeholders can make informed decisions to optimize supply chain processes and ensure business continuity.
