# Handedness and Mortality Refactored

This refactored version of the analysis splits the notebook logic into Python modules for better maintainability.

## Modules
- `data_utils.py`: Handles data loading and preprocessing.
- `plot_utils.py`: All visualizations.
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the full analysis.

## To Run
```bash
python main.py
```
