*Maze Runner*


ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The goal of this project is to create an interactive maze game that allows users to navigate through a procedurally generated maze using directional commands.

ðŸ§¾ Description

This project is Maze Runner, where users can engage with a maze, trying to find the exit while managing their moves. The application generates a random maze based on selected difficulty levels and keeps track of user movements, providing feedback on their progress.

ðŸ§® What I Have Done!

1. Implemented a maze generation algorithm to create a playable maze with walls and paths.
2. Developed a player movement system that allows users to navigate through the maze using directional buttons.
3. Integrated a scoring system that evaluates player performance based on the path taken and moves made.
4. Included a user interface with clear visual feedback and messages for winning or losing the game.

ðŸ“š Libraries Needed

1. random - For generating random maze layouts.
2. ipywidgets - To create interactive buttons and display elements in Jupyter Notebook.
3. IPython.display - For rendering HTML and managing output in the notebook.

ðŸ“¢ Conclusion

In conclusion, the Maze Runner project highlights an engaging way for users to challenge themselves in navigating mazes. The code serves as a foundational platform for potential enhancements, such as different maze designs, additional features, or multiplayer options.
