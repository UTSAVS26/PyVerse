Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

ðŸŽ¯ Goal
The goal of this project is to create an engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows players to compete against a computer opponent in a fun and interactive way.

ðŸ§¾ Description
This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where players choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) and compete against a randomly selected move from the computer. The game determines the winner based on standard rules and provides immediate feedback on each round. It tracks the score across multiple rounds, creating a competitive experience. By implementing fundamental programming concepts in Python, it offers an entertaining way for users to engage with a classic game.

ðŸ§® What I had done!

Created a command-line interface for users to input their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
The game consists of multiple rounds where players can play against the computer, receiving immediate feedback on wins, losses, or ties.
At the end of the series of rounds, players receive their total score, and the game summarizes the results.
ðŸ“š Libraries Needed

random - To randomly select the computer's choice from the available options.
ðŸ“¢ Conclusion
In conclusion, this Rock-Paper-Scissors project demonstrates essential programming concepts such as random selection, user input handling, loops, and scoring in Python. It offers an engaging experience that encourages users to have fun while testing their luck and strategy. The code is straightforward yet effective, making it an excellent learning project for beginner developers aiming to enhance their understanding of basic programming logic.
