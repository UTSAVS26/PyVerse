Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create an engaging Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows players to compete against a computer opponent in a fun and interactive way.

🧾 Description
This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where players choose their move (rock, paper, or scissors) and compete against a randomly selected move from the computer. The game determines the winner based on standard rules and provides immediate feedback on each round. It tracks the score across multiple rounds, creating a competitive experience. By implementing fundamental programming concepts in Python, it offers an entertaining way for users to engage with a classic game.
